2020-11-03 00:17:50,468:WARNING: From bilstm_crf.py:65: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.

Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.

Instructions for updating:
Use tf.where in 2.0, which has the same broadcast rule as np.where
