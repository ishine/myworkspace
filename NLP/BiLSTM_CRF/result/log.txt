2020-11-03 00:03:49,101:WARNING: From bilstm_crf.py:65: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
2020-11-03 00:03:49,109:WARNING: From bilstm_crf.py:69: LSTMCell.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.
2020-11-03 00:03:49,110:WARNING: From bilstm_crf.py:77: bidirectional_dynamic_rnn (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.RNN(cell))`, which is equivalent to this API

Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor
2020-11-03 00:03:49,194:WARNING: From /home/gzc/.conda/envs/zhanchao/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/rnn.py:244: where (from tensorflow.python.ops.array_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.where in 2.0, which has the same broadcast rule as np.where
