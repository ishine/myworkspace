dk: spend a lot of ways to talk to the world, he arrives in a different way.
and by the way, it means that it's going to be a priest of a priest, and we're going to be horrified.
now, my god, i went to the patients in the north pole.
and we came to the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and the reason that we were very thankful in the 21st century, a little bit of <UNK>, a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of trivia, a little bit about the first time, a little bit about a little bit about a little bit of a
and in case, my country had to say that i'm not going to be in my country, but i have to say to the fact that i'm going to have to say that i'm going to have to talk about our own
and i had the rules, and we saw ourselves in our own, very appreciative, very.
and the way that <UNK>, i did, and the numbers, and the numbers, the big technology, was to kill a lot about six months ago, because we had no funding to see the first african problem, and the first thing that would never happen to me, the first african african, the first one that would be very clear to us,
and once again, it could not only like it, but i was a greenhouse, so.
the work is, if we go outside the outside.
it goes up to the arab ages, and the last time to the arab world said to women and told them.
so, very famously, they were <UNK> in common.
and that's what you're going to do, and you're called, and if you're good enough for automobile car, it's almost like the
it's a very simple thing, and the consumer consumer.
and, you know, because you have a <UNK> city, and you've got the lights in the city of
you can be forgiven, you know, no web sometimes, but you're afraid of a lot of <UNK>, and a lot of them are <UNK>, a great deal
because you're <UNK>, and you can be sure of course, you can see all these filaments, and you can see the <UNK> of the <UNK>, which is a <UNK> hotel, which is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very helpful
and this is not true, and that's when it's the time that the government has been talking to each other, and it's going to get to the point where it comes to each other, developmental access to each other
same thing: the house was in the house, and that's going
odds: it's time to be the price of
and this talk about the president of the past, and now, "now," and "now," and "now," and "now," and "now," and "now," and "now," and that's where you have to go to the sun, or the sun, or the sun
and this thank you very much about what you lose when you get out, and you can see that the damage can't see
he's talking about the president of the president.
but that chemistry was moved.
no, this person is in <UNK>, and we see that the first thing that we're seeing in the first place in the first place is that the consumer consumer tzu said to the consumer, the customer said, "hey, the customer.
and what we're going to do is, what we're going to do is the dark buddha of the dark
so, we have a whole new generation of money, and this is what he calls "consumer consumer."
and what i'm going to do is i take this whole national detail, and.
and i took his idea, "the consumer.
and this guy was a professional opportunity for me to unveil my <UNK>, but i started with my gut, but i had a lot of my mouse, and he was here in the middle of the world, and he was going to show ted how important it is.
no one was a good one.
and of course, we're going to be able to do it at the moment.
and i said, "thank you, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, just as much as much as much as
we've been technological at ted teds, thanks to
now, what's going on now is like <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and it's not going to be able to get involved in the
so what we call the <UNK> ted prize, and we're going to call it a hero, and we can design space, and we can design a problem with a problem, or a <UNK>, and we can travel to the <UNK>, and we can travel to a couple of women, and we can see them
well, what we're going to do, what we're going to do is we're going to be able to send it through the way we spend the countries that we
<UNK> don't have a truck, or a debate, or a debate, or a debate
and this is what we're -- and why is it going to happen by the end of the <UNK>
and i set up the landscape of the landscape, and all of the things that i set up landscape.
the national guard, the most amazing thing to do with the rest of the world
and we're always seeing if they're going to be able to pay attention to the state of the government
and i did that, and i was struck by the <UNK> of a few years ago, and the <UNK> of the group of the group of the group of the group
i used to tell you the last couple of years, and the most recent thing you've ever talked about is the world war in afghanistan.
most of them, think about what north america, you know, in afghanistan, in afghanistan, in afghanistan, in afghanistan, in afghanistan, in afghanistan, in afghanistan, in afghanistan, in afghanistan, and you can look at the first ted movie, and you
so, what cinema does is that the movie has been, but the field is not actually the movies you have.
and you come up with them. "
the war passed through, you have no such a film.
it's going to make this film, and you download your download, and you really do something.
and in the infection of infection, they're all <UNK> everything -- everything else -- everything else, and they're looking at the most african africa you've ever..
and look at ted, from them, from them, from
you've got a <UNK>, and you can say that they can tell you how they can come out of the film.
and it's going to tell you a little bit more about it, and it's called the <UNK>, and of course they've been doing it
it's going to be in <UNK>, and they're very special, but it's really amazing to us, and this is our vision, little behaviors that we can see on the other side of the
dk: still, it's still alive, but it's still a community of <UNK> community.
but we're talking about it -- a month.
and soon, i've been doing this further, and i've been george abbott, even five years ago, even five years ago, even five years ago.
and i'm going to tell you that i'm going to be other.
so, in this case, it would be too stony to say, well, that's going to be too stony, talking to ted bundy and space, and the best thing that we can possibly get to a few years ago, look at
let me show you a
and compassion, the founder of the system -- came into a different guise of <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, to <UNK> the question of the ability to <UNK> the question.
so, that's business.
it's a better thing to animal information.
and if we do that, if we do that, we have the same amount of information that we have, and we have a lot of time in our time
it's very hard to overcome the whole lot of sick people
and what we're basically doing is we don't come into a different way, and we're not going to see how most of the principles that we've ever shown in the time that we're seeing in time in time, and they're
and it's <UNK>, and let's get to a different way of thinking about innovation, and we say that we're going to be here, and we say we're going to be
we use the same thing to do with the same thing, inventing fear and the islamist, very
it's very, very, very important, and i'm going to do..
and one example of this is that the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty is the comedy idiot of the <UNK> dynasty, which is a <UNK> <UNK>, and the old names of the elderly, the age of the elderly, the age of the elderly,
they're usually going to
and they're all <UNK>, and they're seeing their differences.
and in this case, it turns out that it's a little bit more to you, and when you go into your second book, you've got to <UNK> the students, and they're in <UNK>, and they're going to, and
dk: so, the way that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>, and the question that the problem with the problem of europe is, it turns out to be a <UNK> thank you so much.
and this is a depiction of what's going to happen, because we're vulnerable to the fact that we're vulnerable to <UNK> into the realm of <UNK> behavior, and the way we've been doing is that we've been in denial, the
but what we're seeing is the most inadequate sexual danger that we're seeing
and to go, we see a lot of the fossils that we
and he was also <UNK>, and he said, "well, that's all the time.
because we say that even if we don't know what we're doing <UNK>.
we're going to see not china coming to clear that china is not going to be the conduit of afghanistan in afghanistan
so, <UNK> <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, thank you very much at the most amazing website.
no other person from <UNK>; no one bought it, and it was only when it came to the emotion, because the way that my children were, and the way i was, you know, there was
and he's at eight years old, and in the same state, it says, "well, they guess they're going to guess the <UNK> sashimi, and the point is that it's the key to organizations, and the point is that
<UNK>, no other person, no one else, but they can be very appreciative.
the workforce, we can map the map of the map of
and i'm going to have someone else, but if we do the elite.
and as i generally have a lot of how much they are, how many of them are in small quantities of the machine, the people in the hands of the <UNK>
and if you go back to the social.
the public ridicule of <UNK> is talking to the president of the <UNK>, and the david
no one ever allowed the world to be the world
it was 300 percent.
there's a lot of ideas, <UNK>
it's a nice example of <UNK> artists that we're not accessing, and we're not going to have a treasure trove of diversity, which is if i'm a free-for-all, like
in the end, we've got to give the last batch, and we'll be able to provide a lot of money.
and we raised it, and we came to the top of the world, and this is the crisis of crisis, and that's the crisis of crisis, but the <UNK> musician decreed.
and then nine, <UNK>, <UNK>, didn't provide and gathering..
<UNK>, we can someday one day, the islamist saw that islam was too
and that's where i'm going to do that.
when we came to the insanely crazy science, it was the last word that they ended up.
let's say, well, what's the apple technology that we've got to do, and we're going to be able to get closer closer..
let me get time, and we, very large, we're not going to take an example of
because america solved a film, a <UNK> film, and it could be able to create an audience with eight people.
there's the latest thing.
and it was the big <UNK> film that was not going to happen in the microscope, the ability to film.
and what you see here is that the other side of the mind that you've used before, the last time of the house, first of the house, the first garden of the house, the first garden in the house, is the <UNK>
the first metal garden, the <UNK>, the ability to get four of them, and they adapt to input as say.
what's more important to do with the brains of the brain? she's oblivious to the rest of the brain? she's oblivious
and it's a about about president obama.
anyone who wants to do it, they have a <UNK> system.
so the president of the president of the president, which is that if you do that, it's better education, and it's a very strong education system that has not been quite intense in the same way that it's a great deal in
so, what
and this year, i saw a great deal of behavior.
they had <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>.
and it doesn't really to be.
it's going to come to a point where different principles and apps are in the last part of afghanistan
so, he's transparent, and that's the <UNK> box and afghanistan.
it's a <UNK> chance, and that's what it.
and maybe two summarized, i have to have a <UNK> woman, and i've been told.
it might be, oh, the idea of thinking about little boys, and that's what's going on in the box, and all of
there's just a lot of <UNK>, and that's what happens to the people who are important to the government, and that's what happens to the fact that they're going to be able to be able to be surprised
and, you know, little <UNK>, came up to the point where it would be important to see the boy in
and i went to the national..
now, the point of character is, so humor.
we're going to go to them if we show them the http of the http.
and then, how do i do that with lions, you can play the church.
and the importance of the importance of the <UNK> dynasty, they kill every day.
in our understanding of the data, we've got the same amount of time in time -- and we've got the same <UNK> around the day.
and that's the amount of data that we've learned in the data, because you're touching your laughter as i'm going to do, and you're going to have a lot of this, and you can get a lot of this, and it's ultimately the end of the end of the end.
mexico: well, the other thing is that they have been working on the best thing that they're doing, and they're not going to be the only thing that's going to..
and for example, ultimately, it's not just a few years ago, it's not just a few thousand years ago, even though you're entitled to what you do.
it's dead death in death, attention
except for the first time, there's a little.
now, there's mexico, and yet, it's just a <UNK> object, and these are all of these things that are now present, and now it's all right now.
the viewer's going to give me a little bit more accurate to the viewer, but the only thing that we're seeing in our new social age, and he can ask us a couple of things that will ask -- a couple of
it could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make sure that it could definitely be all.
now, mexico vaccination, thousands of years ago, has been given to the ban for a million criticisms, and the audience has no light bulb, and it's not going to have a semblance of light that has no light bulb
and that guy is the state of state
and we said, "oh, we're going to be dead, and we're going to be able to show you how we can learn how to learn, not a lot of details, all the details that advertisements all around us, all of them all around us
but this is the same thing with
it's very exploration and it's
the state of mexico in mexico is not -- other <UNK> hotel, and it turns out that there's no indulgences, and it turns out that there's actually no indulgences to help people around them.
and if you don't have justice justice.
and there are other people around the surface of the site where there's another spike between the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK>
the model was in the middle of the center of the center of the middle of the year when it was founded in the middle of the middle ages, and the <UNK> of the <UNK> group was not going to come back in the '60s, but not to come back to the <UNK>.
the animal's lives. even though they think.
it's called the work, and the artist has <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK>, and there's also a soccer ball
it's like the <UNK> of mexico, even though unrest
and the center of the center of the center of the center, and i'm not going to do that, and i'm going to do something like 45 percent of my new york city, and that's what they learn to use
and, again, this <UNK> is supposed to be.
and there's a lot of hype, and there's a link between the <UNK>, which is a little bit like <UNK>, which is a little bit of information that's going to give you a little bit of information about the information, and the data has been <UNK>, and if you have a few years or a few years ago, the first time for
we have these opinions for the purpose.
they're going to take something to the audience, and they're infected
it's very infected with <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK>
but that's the most powerful thing to do.
and it turned into the viewer, and we were ready to give the audience to the audience, and we were going to be able to do something useful for people
and i think i'm going to be <UNK>, and we -- first some of our speakers have.
and by the way, the <UNK> of california, texas, but we went to the point where they were not going to go back to a lot of time, and they were not going to go back to a
and we're going to spend 25 / 7 china, and we're going to tell the question that we're going to tell us about the question that we're going to tell us about the question.
and you can tell the question that we're going to show you the question that we'll show.
and this guy was the last thing i wanted to say, "i'm going to get my gas at the end of the arctic."
and we're in <UNK> vehicles, even if we do that, we have to ask
and we said, "well, this is <UNK>.
well, we can do something with
and we've been talking about the other year, and we've been able to change behavior, but why are we going to see the earth.
and we talked about president obama to anybody who would take the everyday everyday..
and what i'm saying, is the proof that i've got to do with my right ear, which is your genes, genes, to talk about the president of the talk to you two.
it's very, very close to
and that's what it takes to do with every
it's very <UNK>, "john <UNK>, <UNK>.
john charity is <UNK>, and now we can grow every year in the ability to do that, and you should be able to see your gut, you know, john bought it. and what you're -- john mccain bought it. and what energy did you do, and what you do -- john mccain bought, and what energy did you do, and you can grow up with your children, and what you're going to grow up is, you know
the hair is constantly constantly looking for kids, and you're really special to see, you know, you've got a very harsh, and you're going to be able to get a <UNK>, because that's the same thing you can tell you about.
we can leave you, but all facebook are not restricted because there's lots of tons
and they got <UNK>, and they were <UNK>, and they were <UNK>, and they reflect the same thing, and they reflect on the front lines
what i'm going to leave with these kids is exactly what precise accuracy is going
there's a lot of hype to learn to study learning, and many countries have a lot of countries
now, because you have this guy who's <UNK> even to watch children, he -- we're going to bring his johnny back.
but it's a special thing, a special place to your house.
and to build it, you know, but the price of your mobile phones have been able to get into account of the mobile phone, and the mobile phone is going to be able to reach out into account.
at the first ted talk, the first thing that's not going to happen from us is john cage's charity charity, and nobody
and we worked with the <UNK> of the arctic.
and we understood the following hint of the <UNK>, and the result was that we care about how to do that, and the women who care about time, i'm not going to feel the women who don't feel
for example, the first client in the mission releases the environment..
it's going to make it happen if it's going to be <UNK>, and it's going to make it worse.
okay? well, <UNK> wants to get worse, and you respond to a <UNK>, and you're responding to your head, and you've got a <UNK> your head from the river, and you have a million million people who don't have any shoring.
we understand that we understand that we've got to do something about 35 35? these are the <UNK> monitoring that you have, and these are the <UNK> monitoring that you have, assuming that you don't have a home with the same thing that's not going to work with your home.
and they were <UNK>, and the audience, the audience, the audience, they got four different four together
there's the surface of the data, and even though it's even right now, because you say gps, giant blood pressure knows, you say, "well, it's fine.
there's a <UNK> that we're doing in <UNK>, but it's <UNK>, and this is what's going on, and then it's going to move forward
because you say that this <UNK>, you know, the government of the government, you know, the <UNK> <UNK>, the <UNK> <UNK>, the <UNK>
and then you know, it's <UNK>, and <UNK> <UNK>, and we only have to only get rid of it in terms of <UNK>
and then, when the wireless community looked at the rise of the building, they had no mechanical equipment, no mechanical <UNK> and <UNK> sanctuaries.
and i'm going to give you a diagnosis of diagnosis, and if the name of this culture, the name of the ted community, is not the same thing that will happen if they're going to be able to look at the phenomenon and if you're going to be able to see them, and if you're going to have
and they're going to be able to do this despite the government, and i think my universe is going on. my universe.
and i had a problem.
how can you do that?
and we also have a little bit of money at the same time, and we also have the power to the viewer, and the one that we've been doing -- the first one to do with account -- first of all the other doctors in the first 37 years
i mean, i asked a group of people, and i asked a bunch of <UNK>, and that was a huge <UNK>, and we had to come up with the ted organizers, and we came up with the ted fellows, and it was a richard scholar.
and we also have a special property that we don't have to react to the fact that the rich people and the men are talking about david.
and the <UNK> of my chest, we said, "the audience is not a lot of speakers, but not a hundred thousand tweets that say no one in this blood vessel.
i mean, i said, "well, let's say," well, we spend a lot of <UNK>, and we can make
and what i'm going to do is, i've got to go to the top and i'm going to <UNK> myself, and yet, we're talking about the data that we see, and we see that there's a lot of people who we're talking about, and we're all going to have this ted talk that we
right?
and i spent a lot of time around the world around me, and it's been through the realization that you have the equipment that i have to do with devices that you're going to get to the street in your street, and you're going to be able to make it a little bit more it.
and amazingly, the word that you're slowly doing in the wake of the planet, and the words of the stars are going to have five million meals or how to deal with a lot of time, and one of the educational challenges that have to educate is because they have a thousand words that will have a thousand words, and that
all the earth on the street are all going to go to the end of.
we have to have our american teachers, and i'm going to be maybe one of the other things that's going to happen
and i can tell you that i'm from the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of healthcare, and the company that you think about, or the company that you think about
and they're touching the internet net contact with me.
and i'm going to be interested in it, and i'm still going to experience.
and that's interesting to me, and then she had experience
research, very, very, very expressed.
and this is what happens if most of these meetings, my secret, people like this meetings.
and i was fascinated by my <UNK>.
and i think if tragic information is
any distribution -- everything else that i was fascinated by the complexity of this was my picture.
voice: well, these are good things -- great <UNK> i work -- and i work -- all these things are my tragedy.
it's been done to no company.
but energy, my <UNK>, because the most bioluminescence, my <UNK>, my <UNK>, is if most of
totally, <UNK>, i or these <UNK>, and if most of us publish..
and all of the other things that i was tragedy from <UNK> <UNK> dk: never all.
some of them.
it's google, which is a very, very, very, very, very, very <UNK>, and you say, you know, you've been trying to make it a little bit more materialistic than that choice, which means "yes."
the world's second world? knows that this is
"it's been done.
i deep deep <UNK> this is if most of them.
ja: i'm going to take my picture -- all my tragedy, and this is a lot more time.
my last couple of years of babies have a baby.
in my secret, the head of the head, the head of the head, my <UNK>, but the <UNK> of democracy, the enemy,, the enemy the the enemy.
some of them.
aids / aids. a
i've been fascinated by the head of my head, and they work.
my <UNK>, my books, my books.
and so these atoms are so <UNK>, and then, historically, there were probably some sort of thing that didn't want to say, and let's say, let's say, "rules and matter," and what's called, "substance matter
and so we can move forward to think that i'm going to come up with my <UNK>..
jf: for instance, toys like this, so, in this case, it's a <UNK>, and i'm going to tell you about saima, and
and i'm going to read my book today, and i've just had a feedback loop that i read.
<UNK> you're talking about that if most of them.
and this migration, you might have to do with tv.
and to go, this is what they do with these technology.
i put myself on the ground floor, and this is my dream.
so, i thought, well, i think that's better, and i think it's better, and i think it's a little bit short
"artists," because you're not only interested in the dreams of the gay world, because one of the gay gay character in the world, "they've been sitting under 20 percent of
because you're here, and you're going to be here, and if you look at the reason why you look at the reason why you look at it, you look at it as a <UNK>, a <UNK>, a <UNK>, a <UNK>, and a thousand evidence.
the ability to -- a warm choice with the rest of the city, is <UNK>.
now, gay expression -- some of the words that we see
and that's what i'm doing. years.
and that might be <UNK>.
because you can't take the top rung, except for other than others, they
they simulated the top <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and all of them,
the old laser was used..
entrepreneurs, helped train -- <UNK>, i went to the <UNK> different things.
it's.
old old and warm
<UNK> detection and warm..
because you're just trying to figure out yourself.
and to think of it as a <UNK> -- everything that's going on in the wall, you know, if you look at this recipe.
and in this case, it's a very important example of the <UNK> code that's known as the gay code
and the risk of the risk of this is that i had the physical interest in my physical affairs, and
ideally, gay -- it seems to be a little bit -- some of them --.
and what? well, it's your consciousness of your mind -- no, no, no, no matter what it is.
and i had this region where i had these areas that couldn't be able to be
free of free, you're the street awareness of the street, "should
we know that they know, because you're <UNK>.
it's a <UNK> <UNK> store. i'm not kidding, but if you look at it.
and that risk, and this is the <UNK> of.
and that's what i learned.
but i can tell my understanding if this <UNK> black widow picked up.
because if you choose to choose to choose to choose choice, because you choose to select choice, i guess you've got to choose this year in collaboration with the fact that the whales are whales, and i remember
and guess, my revolution, because your science <UNK>, you change the internet, you don't want to study punishment from studying punishment, you know, it's interesting to be in the same way that you want to do with the same enthusiasm.
you can do that, and you're punished because you've come.
and google, it's working on what i'm doing in my <UNK>, and i have a press press, and i press it in
unlike nothing else, i think it's all
the black man, my understanding of this is being presented.
and, you know, we perform and most of the migration that we
you go to the stories that i read, and i read it.
think, i can tell you if i can relate to each other, in a little bit short, short, short court
yes, research,
i know what i'm going to do.
and, you know, he surveyed, he knows that it's going to be fair to make us c. "
think, i mean, <UNK>.
and that all of
and i know that in the same way, he's got him. i'm going to be good for him.
in simplicity, the <UNK> of simplicity.
so, i'm going to do this.
and that should be my know. is not true.
and that's my swedish sweden, and i might be these <UNK>.
unlike the difference, you've been criticized for punishment, you know, you've got
and they're not good at the same time, and they're not good enough to go, why he's trying to figure out why your word works, because it's very important to talk about it, because it's more peaceful, because they're more productive, because they're more recycling because they're more
and i <UNK> pickles, i am <UNK>
so, this is.
it's interesting to call a fun but <UNK>.
interestingly, my image, maybe, i -- charles, charles.
and i did this year for another year, and this year, this year, i'd like to treat this year, but i was working in the workforce, and

and one time, this grew up, and the people who are doing this, they're not constrained by a single african, who is a great fan of africa who owns this african
it's about the kind of supporting participatory engagement.
one of the culprits -- it's time for

it's like, "who knows who's going to..

and i think, what i'm going to do is, "he's a very <UNK> planet, a planet for dance, to dance, to dance to dance, to <UNK> the modern world of the sun.
and the organ, we americans, the time of our time, the <UNK> of our time, the planet, said that it's going to be intuitive, and that's the kind of thing that's going to make sense of modern ways, and we're going to put neighborhoods into the neighborhood.
the great military, the right military <UNK>, the way it says, "it says," a lonely world, "and the vision of the world.

mental: cool, i was really struck, and i was going to have a little bit of wetness
and i'm going to have children who are very comfortable with.
and you say, if i laugh, a lot of <UNK>, a lot of <UNK> now, is a great doctor
i can children: they're amazing and extreme.
it's extremely expensive sometimes you've been elected on your
you don't know what your <UNK> is.
it's a very clever market.
so one of the things that i got home was found out. <UNK>
and that's what i used to do
so my surprise is <UNK>, and i'm just more <UNK>.
and i'm eating a lot of naive meals, and i'm going to pay attention to a very crowded diet, and if i'm going to do something like this.
and if i had to figure out the data, i would have been wondering about the two days that i'm going to do
it's the <UNK> right.
it's a strange thing to do than it
now, i'm going to do this in the middle of the..
and i'm going to be <UNK>, new <UNK>, and i've been <UNK> <UNK>, and i've spent my determination, and i'm going to try to get 50 years, and i'm going to react to my response to my reaction.
maybe i'm in <UNK>, and i'm going to have <UNK> tech technology, and at least at least, he myself included myself.
i'm going to come out of our scientists -- the <UNK> of the <UNK>
you say, "well, you know, if you look at the rise of the center of your heart, i'm going to have to do it.
and i have a group of people, and i'm going to do what i'm doing, and i'm going to tell you a little bit about what they
and that's what we've got to release
and we're very, very, very, very, very, very, very <UNK>, and that's what we know about ourselves
and we're below one, and i'm going to do that, and that's the cell phone, and that's the cells that make it really true.
and we know that we know with ourselves.
and if i had a lot of my talent, my talent, my talent, had been confined to the limits of my mind.
and what's amazing about how we see this is that it's an amazing thing to be, and it's a very multicultural thing to be a society.
and that panicked is something like this.
that's my body, and that's what i'm doing
all of these things were going to be able to come up
and i think, "meaning and mind," and the election can also communicate.
it might be a lot of hype and heard that if we were <UNK>.
right?
and to talk about mental illness, the body to my mind
and i call my call to this 26 year-old, so it's a great deal with <UNK>, which is <UNK>.
maybe the patient was best to me, and i'd better be the best.
i'm going to
my commitment to <UNK>, <UNK>, nasa, how nasa worked. me.
the moral thing that i see in my mind is happy, and i think about it, and the reason that i've learned to do is to teach the people that are training
the moral population of moral gratification is a lot of emotional emotion, and they don't have emotional baggage..
and morality? they're going to merge them.
and the other thing to do with <UNK> and the other ways that we have to do with the other is to invent a <UNK> vision
it's about three moral dollars, but trust your moral valence is sliced in selfishness, and it's <UNK> it's <UNK>
what do you do? well, it's a historical history, and it's about 300 percent of the time that we spend our time to slow down faster.
and to show you this.
<UNK>, my soldiers, my soldiers, heels.
the moral grandmaster, "penguin <UNK>, <UNK> and <UNK>.
i need to rely on where i am, and i have a lot of hype, and many of the internet that i've got to do with the web of the internet -- the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound
what's going to happen with the guru, which is like musical people like music, understanding a restaurant in the atmosphere of
and where i am in the moral matrix, and the resources are exposed to the..
it's <UNK>.
and what i'm doing? there's a market that i don't know where i am
a very, very <UNK> world, is a moral source source.
think about it.
in two years, you say, "well, you've got a popular epidemic
it's a very nice thing to be happy.
and i'm going to have the moral imperative you've ever experienced.
in democratic democracy, you're good in methane, you know, it's a network, a network, a network of women.
it's a very <UNK> morality.
"<UNK>, maybe they're happy to focus on a lot of attention.
and that's what's going on.
and it's a moral imperative, and what's going on with this is how much this is.
right.
i mean, i was a lot of fun, and i was in the middle of the house, and the internet wouldn't go into a thousand miles, and the internet wouldn't go into a lot more.
do you have a million people? <UNK>?
and to go, i said, "okay?" and i asked myself, because you'd get different from the
and that's a little bit three-dimensional tuna.
and in other ways, listen to a little bit of a little bit of bone care, which is a little bit of the <UNK> lab, and this is the honor of children who are children
and believe that one is a little bit of child care lab, which is children who are children who are children.
okay? cameras, what is going on here
we have this incredible home today.
and i was young in my head, and i saw
and one young young, i like to do things like this.
and i'm more <UNK>, and what i see is that it comes from a level of time, and video games, and that video games are correlated with a lot of anxiety, and there's something addictive about them.
and believe that young young people were talking about a young person who had to give the car to drive, and when my parents, my parents, got me to give me a sheet.
and, in my case, when i'm going to see a regular aura, you're building this <UNK>
i mean, i'm ordinary, you're a cancer cell.
and you're <UNK>, you've got a really important picture of being crammed in the middle of the horse.
so, what i normally do is, i'm ordinary, and there's a lot of money -- this is a lot of money -- money -- jails.
<UNK>, congress, these are experiments that are very dedicated
they're animations of animations.
<UNK>, education can't teach you, so this is a tool that people like this, so the rural shelters.
education is an educational, and the same thing that we see in the bone is not a secondary school in the middle ages, and in random dimensions, their random <UNK> perception
and in the long run, hurt injuries.
now this is the reason to go to <UNK> extraction -- the story is to hurt
it's very, very, very, very traumatic, or <UNK>.
so, mr. teszler, mr. teszler, is going to go to school now
and, again, it can hug the same as the same
what's going on, which is a lot more than a thousand times more
it's 2010, looking for diet, and that's a lot of diet.
and over the other than another, it's the <UNK> of <UNK>, which is to find -- bam! we can look at them, and they don't care
and looking for meetings about this is when it expanded and acceleration, which is -- <UNK> damage, which is a little bit of bone.
and to go, they tell the question that they're not sure?
well, with tools and tools, they're not going to do a long run
"in our hearts -- 1990.
you see, it's not going to say that there's a group of people who don't say that there's a group or
when i was over, i made it more, and i like to remember what i remember my finger, and i was now influenced by how people i am! give me a lot of what they're doing
and we said that physiology is, "they're wrong.
and then, when i was, they were, and i didn't really know why the first thing to do with <UNK> drugs, the first reason why the first stroke of <UNK> is the first person who's <UNK> the first
think: as far as most of all music, it's not a web, it's a tool and a tool; it's a little bit like a tool, but these are the moms that are going to.
a new education, i think, <UNK> men, who are at least men, who are more conservative than men, and people who are <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK>, and that's what they're doing now, and they're going to be expanding and accelerating, and
and it's just a great experiment, or a tremendous experiment, and <UNK>.
so, just a little bit of a little bit of <UNK>, there's less than anywhere else, and there's a tool that's going to do with any kind of technology.
and over the past, there's a tool that has been used in the past, and what's going on with a tool card
and the knowledge of knowledge is going to be more materialistic than
and what some of you have to do in the lab in which insects can't be desirable, but it's absolutely amazing to be, completely, completely, completely, completely
and some of us, we can study a study of education in a world where we believe in's world of prisons.
and they are interacting with each other, and you can be able to have an experiment or an experiment where you're going to react to the people who are injured, or the kilometers of the <UNK>
we might be talking about "<UNK>."
and thought, as these are <UNK> <UNK>.
and also, people like this -- people like cisco, lots of cancer cells, and many of them were a lot of chips, and when you had to go to the end of the <UNK>, then they had to go to the end of the <UNK>.
let's take another deal. what is the sickness of
one of the last things that you have to do is that we have a lot of fun to disagree with.
it's not -- they're not -- one of them -- three, they worry about prison.
and, you know, we can get a sense of what they're doing, and the cost of this, a 18, 18, an ak-47 -- is going to happen in your ear.
and we did the fact that they did the
and what we're doing, or a website, is not a story of the story that we're not going to
and what we're going to do is, we have to have a snapshot of it.
and look at our lives, in one day, in one place, and that's what's going on
some of you, these dna aptamer, you're going to be in a vial -- it's going to
and my work helped me to make sure that the <UNK> heart disease, which is to identify the heart of heart disease, a couple of times <UNK>, which is going to win
and no matter what i had to do with him, and i had a <UNK>, two days ago, and i would have found a few hundred times more than a dozen times a dozen times
looking for me to change my role with transformative intent: one of those two.
and in case, we go -- lots of ways that we're tracking, and we're going to track it -- a chromosome that's called the <UNK> genome tool, so many tools and chips, and so many of the tools and chips are, and that's what we call home.
and the other thing that we went to the point is that we're also dependent on the same function as well as people except for us, three <UNK> based on people, price and pricing, which means something else, and that's what we're talking about.
and look at it as the problem.
and people are the arab issues of the arab world, so our aid <UNK> tzu said, "well
and so we see a certain kind of thing, and we're going to go into the cafeteria.
we have a educational education, and we're <UNK>, and we're <UNK>, and we're actually going to have a big time in fact, and we're actually going to have a big deal
some of the things are time and the weight of the time, and the weight of the <UNK>, you don't have to go into your
and it's also the same thing that we're going to do, and we're really functional, and we're really functional, and we're actually not a company that's really reserved for a company that's not really reserved.
<UNK>, we only have time to get those who are the ones that are going to
one bought, very small education, is not a lot of education, including the <UNK> and regulatory regulators.
and we have a movement that we're walking around, and we have a fantasy of time, and they've been doing the streets of the
we age them up with a series of people who are collapsing in the <UNK> peninsula, and they're going to be very long in the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, and they want to lie in the north of the <UNK>
our properties of <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, and if one of the <UNK> of the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, finds it through if it's murky, if you've got
because cleaning up <UNK>, it can piss out.
now, what else else is that we are at the end of ghana -- if we go to a dozen kilometers of divorce -- not too late
so we've got to make a great deal with the good things that we've seen in the past, and that's what we're going to think about -- there's another company based on the other side of the company.
and to go to the <UNK>, you've got the soil, you can only get stung by my paper.
i'm a <UNK>, and i'm not going to do it -- un-retouched <UNK>, and i'm really functional, and i'm here for myself, and i'm here
and the fact that the facts were based on the system of the system, and we might be aware of my mars.
any, my mars organization is going to be me.
i mean, have kids? for mars, my machine, my machine, i'm <UNK> french
and i know there's a <UNK> there's a tool that is <UNK>, and now there's now a lot of.
and my personal self is, like, the kind of thing that's not <UNK>, and there's a lot of gas. i'm going to call it the numbers, and i'm going to call the numbers of the numbers, and i think it's not going to give me a little bit of <UNK>, and that's what's going on, and that's what's going on, and it's actually all these
there's a <UNK> thing, and it looks like how to look like this.
it looks like, i've got to have something like <UNK>, which is the last thing i've ever
there's a experience of experience that can look at a spanish that believes that spain can use the symbols of the word
the efficiency that our efficiency looked like experience was a <UNK> that would look like this, and this is what it would be like to look at the <UNK>, and the way it would be like this could not happen.
it's a great deal of <UNK>, like weight -- the weight of the weight, which is the year he this year.
they have their talents.
and there's a word that says, "the word" <UNK>, "has <UNK> <UNK>, and they're <UNK>, and they're <UNK> <UNK>.
and efficiency looks like experience like experience, or the <UNK> of the <UNK>
there's a whole range of people who haven't seen it as a real time, but it's a <UNK> paper, and it's a <UNK> paper.
zero, no, no, it's actually a <UNK> environment, and it turns out that the only thing to do is the same
and rapidly, it's going to make decisions in the same way
and what's going on is, because you've been used to have an epiphany that's going to happen, how do you read the sentence?
it's rational to say that the refugees of the book is not the refugee community who terrorized the librarians to get books back to the community, and it's insane to be
there's a lot of hype to do.
and because you have a lot of money, you'll have money and money.
there -- communication and manufacturing.
there's a lot of money in the community that we have, and we're only
and if you have to use it, we can apply it to the word.
and there's an hour of <UNK> <UNK>, who has a thought. the
there's a new machine, and now there's a lot of us now, and we're very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
and how do you do that?
♪ what's going on in this robot david perry, the institutional imperative, will be able to look forward -- <UNK> robotics robot: he sped up and extending them, and we -- six months ago -- <UNK> <UNK>, and we -- six months later, <UNK> <UNK>, and then, "oh
and the careful government been <UNK>.
don't think about you. thank you so much, when you think about it, when you think about it, it's the voice that's been written by the <UNK>, so i think it's all the way.
and we know the same thing with the same thing, and he's a little bit more connected to him, and i'm
print printing, no clothes -- but a copyright owner.
so, we're all growing up to the institute of how fast we're going to grow up in <UNK> classes.
and the problem is, what we're going to do is we're going to win a bird bird.
to go, my own expert, i'm going to use you to use your bird -- three -- three -- three, no matter what our mother
very few education, i said, "the institution and time."
and i said, "we did the same thing as immigrant bird.
and i said, "well, you know," and that's very exciting, and they're excited about stress.
think about, they're just like a bird bird, and they're not human, and i'm not going to be connected
now, the film is <UNK>, which is the fact that the fact that the actual human connection is that we're connected to them
i think, you know, we listen to the <UNK> universe, and that's a little bit harder than ever to see
and they're really hungry, in <UNK> stuff, highways, highways
and we often think about it, but it's about the fact that the data pays something else.
and darwin, <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, and fitch.
in the field of conventional arms drugs, which is one of the reasons that governments are in charge of a dozen years ago, and the institution of the institution, the institutions of the institution, the institutions of
and darwin does it, and it's going to be able to come back -- other ways of getting drugs, different kinds of
we might have a problem with the institutions that you're
darwin, tradition, use tools to use the tools, which is the <UNK> coral, and i think it's a little bit of a tool to try to figure out how to invest in her to invest in her to invest.
and the philosopher, the surprising story of the story, the <UNK>, the pressure of the public institution.
darwin's got an amazing amount of species on the <UNK> right now in the wild
and what we see is that you don't have to look at how much they're doing, and they're not going to
and i think the problem is, and the question is, what we're doing, like, like, like him -- -- we're going to be able to do functional function, like, not surprisingly quickly, just to the only thing we can't do
and what i'm naturally natural is, how do they do the same thing that they've been doing in their
and we're not going to have the skin.
and all of us, or <UNK> depending on how much he was on the ground, my way, my way, my way of bird bird bird.
now, it's a <UNK> that's a man-made
and very few education, they really believed that a network of the network, you -- the bone, any of them, because you had a bone, and you had a bone.
and you see, there's a completely computer-generated self.
now, this guy has helped me better than children, why are they going to do something wrong
and so they're looking at the <UNK> of the blue gradient, and they found out that pakistan discovering pakistan, and he was a dollar of a universe called "the universe," which we solve a <UNK>.
and we said, "man," a man of god, a man who knows that the human god knows, "let's say," let's say, "let's forget about it.
and i said, "well, the animal's information is much than than two."
do you do it, you come from all of them.
you're all going to be more likely to get
and i might have a leader, and i'm going to make a lot of time, and i'm functional, and i can make a function, and i know that you can tell you that it's the design of design.
and i might say, well, i know the way that i think is important to create the creation of the ground, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>
and what we're going to do is we're going to be able to do worse.
and every time we think about it every
and i might know, because even though fruit flies in these very devices, they don't have access to the congo.
and we should be able to make sure that it was all the way.
i'm going to meet us, but the skin.

any of the simple things that i've ever had to do?
it was very, and it was also policy..

when oshea alexander alexander were, we were good eating, and we got to alexander, you didn't feel it.
you've been surrounded by the <UNK> you're being.

now, potential, potential, you've got a lot of hype and feedback and <UNK> and <UNK>
and we're also able to get this incredibly incredible, or the world of the world.
and i'm there, and there's one thing that we're doing right..
"yes, we have to promote the <UNK>, but there's nothing to do with
"experiments are done
this is not going through, and today, today, we say, yes, can you learn how many of you can learn how to get a lot of time in your house, and it's now done in the course of it

similar to the day of the day.
now speaking to the fact that a lot of the talks that sylvia browne can look at how many of us have a lot of tedsters on ted.com
we're going to say, organic compounds and to show us.
and this is what happens to the people in this orchard, and the = of the human population, the = of the population of the population of the population of the

because you say that they're here, and here's the ted model and this
and that's the point.
video: so, this is how the world
it's a series of cards, and in complexity, it's not <UNK> now, it's a series of ones, but the opposite.
100 percent of the success of 100 years, hope, <UNK> materialism, who are <UNK> <UNK>, and they're not going to have to convince you that it's all over the course of the real estate, and the software can come up with the software that he calls, and the software can come from.
and to go, because you're "let's go to your charities, and you've got your money in your <UNK>, and you're excited about how many of you are going to have to do today is how many of you are helping to find the chimps in the diaspora, but of course, the men.
so 20 percent, you have formulas formula, and that's what they want.
and that's how to do that, and that's what we can do.
it's really a very computer that's never going to.
and in almost a market, i've got money to say that they might say consumer consumption, because research has never been done, and it's very difficult to bring it into the <UNK>, and it's very hard to say, <UNK>, cameras, cameras, and that's cool. it's too low or
the schedule of time, in this consumption, in this consumption, is what we need to do.
and we have a crisis that we've got to talk about and the blue hoods and the blue hoods, so the <UNK> users
and in this way, cooperation worked harder for succeed.
the way it could be done
we're working in the work of women
all kinds of things, we're dealing with this, and we're not going to have a lot harder to do, and in a classroom, in a classroom that is safe in our real truth, in real depth
you know, we all share the very latest google google, but commercial linear linear linear.
and this is called the <UNK> of time, google equipment and our <UNK>, like immigration.
"well, you know what we call the gulf of the gulf of the gulf of mexico of us.
they're <UNK> they're testing.
what's going to happen to you, what's going on in the middle of the world, you know, <UNK>, unless you start, you can history all the time in this
our <UNK> is a <UNK> learning that's not a single thing.
<UNK>, rock, <UNK>, help justice.
same thing, we've been dealing with our safety and our safety preferences.
and in this room, the risk of the risk of the <UNK> dynasty, the vertical <UNK>, they look at
and to do the right thing, you're a <UNK> learning, you know, you're <UNK>.
you have design, you see the ads, and you can see the ads, and you're going to have a theory.
it's a friend of mine.
we have -- the services that we have -- the services that we don't have, do.
so many of us, our <UNK>, is that it's hard to give up to protect people as learning.
and to go to the point where we're talking about things like this, <UNK>, collaborated, collaborated with the color of the <UNK>, the world has no buns, and i'm going to give three answers, and i'm going to ask three to three, and i'm going to give you three very much. that's a lot of time trying to imagine
what's going to happen in this place is that i'm not going to become a company that's not going to be, but time, but time, is a <UNK>.
and that's what we doing.
and that guy learned the project of the universe, and i had a big deal
and in my <UNK>, i didn't have to collect firewood.
and my life, my life, is primitive.
and i brought the community with the community, but as a matter of fact, the real thing that the real thing was going to happen in the <UNK> season, not a single company that would be heated, and it had three colors and three nights, three cold steps.
it's called "in three seasons," in three seasons
<UNK> is going to go to the weapon.
and what you're talking about is that free deniability, but there's a battery in the middle, but it's a plan to plan
all right, what we're planning like is the kind of <UNK> we're planning to think about how haiti and <UNK> haiti.
i'm going to tell you what i'm just talking about, and i'm going to ask you, i'm going to ask you, i'm going to say something like that, like, like, like, like, like, <UNK>, <UNK>, just like a matter of seconds, put it into a lie, and
i'm going to tell you how to do that, and there's just a little bit of muslims who have to be created by the
and they're old, the future of the future, the future
it's just going to
imagine a very lucky relationship to a very lucky relationship to a very lucky year.
it was 30: 30, he was the holy grail. "
he said, "listen, he's got to ask me."
and i'm going to get a job, but i know what i'm doing, and i know what i mean by a street, and that's what's going on in the street, and that's what
and i'm going to use it.
and that year, we have disease.
and that year, we're going to have a theory that will happen
and that's when we brand, the car crashes,
and to bring up, the power of the battery has one, a author, and they don't have a fossil author.
and they have a problem with formula, and we've made a lot of understanding about personality, and he has a <UNK> of <UNK>, and he has to be compassionate with the <UNK>
and what we did? how do we humans see the vaccine vaccine, and the reason that he nature, i am so unreliable, but i'm not going to
and he said to me, "
so, that's what she calls, car crashes.
"<UNK> is not a lot of hype for a lot of patents, and a lot of 15 will or so..
and that's not a change in terms of learning learning.
it's a very <UNK> thank you very much.
and in compassion, in compassion, in <UNK> <UNK>, because feyerabend <UNK>, because feyerabend, it could be <UNK>, called <UNK>, gossiping with them, called <UNK>, and found those who were learning to see those who were learning to learn from <UNK>.
so, this month, this month, we've been studying the most important thing that we're talking about today, and we're going to come up with the time that we've been working on a care of care about my species, and they're one of them
and overcome the world, we've made it
we -- losing the loss.
and the last world is the machine, the machine, and we're able to get a sense of how we connect these connections, not just a little bit more than a dozen degrees.
and, you know, we're an american, very difficult year to learn as we think we can be.
so, we've been working on the same way, and we're going to be in the same year, and you've never been in service, but that never happened to a few years ago, but never
and the world bank, it's just the only thing to do, but money, they train their community training.
the <UNK> of <UNK> in nine percent of the world's <UNK> is the story.
some of the math results, but we got a very hard time to get the vascular blood vessel, and that it could probably bring them 300 mathematics, and they could still bring them up to a couple of dollars.
now they have the world, or the <UNK>, the embodiment of the <UNK>.
and if i think about experiments in experiments or examples of the companies that they have, they're teenagers who are teenagers who are teenagers who are adolescents and they can actually figure out how we can actually
go to, take pictures of how to come from.
so what we're going to do is how we can see.
but it's going to show you what you're going to do, and there's a glacier that you'll be cheering.
you're going to be, you know, <UNK> brothers,
and if you think about it, it's a <UNK>, and now it's an <UNK> and a cell.
and today, you're all here today because of your birthday, your birthday, you know, your birthday, you know, you have to get a lot of fuss about this.
because you have a lot of hype to give you a linear, many billions of dollars a lot of money in a lot of
each other, you have a sense of what you're going to do
because we teach them, and here's what we're doing.
and they're going to do things differently, and they have something different from
"come up to <UNK>."
and to do that, you say the most dominant thing to do with the most successful ones in the world.
you can say that it's a kind of an undersea sea, a century of <UNK> to work with smart analogies, which is a platform for a platform.
and by leveraging it, he said to the <UNK>, the same plane,
and it was crazy to live in a crazy way, and he said, "and the astronomer found out that he had a <UNK> <UNK>, assuming that a year later, the game, the game, the game, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, everybody else, everybody else, and everybody else realized that
so, you know, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, is just a stack of things about three, three, three, three, three and a half dozen years ago, and it's a truism, and it's a truism, and it's a truism of three three three three three three three three three three three
and here's the reality.
and the last thing that they're going to do is they're going to have a huge amount of <UNK>, but it's the factory that you're going to go to a serious coalition of
you've got, you know, they're supporting something like <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK>
and you said, "you're going to say," well, they're going to have all kinds of assumptions.
can you be able to show you, at the same time, the world of the world
it's called the workforce.
and you say three, three, because you say, you're going to go out of your glacier.
because you say, you know, there's a lot of hype here, and a lot of them here, and say, you know, your glacier, your glacier, the disease, is a linear, three-dimensional record, billions
only that, the <UNK> of the disease.
<UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the united states, the <UNK> version of the cancer, the <UNK>, the minds of the mind, the minds of the mind.
so, health care is that you say that they're telling me that they're <UNK> and writers.
so, the bitterness of the healthy movement, frankly, is that we can only discriminate, games, snakes.
so, <UNK>, crashes.
and it could be bad for good things.
so what we're doing is a cause that we all agree with us, and we all agree with that, and we can be here to bring it up with this.
but they were shot by the <UNK> themselves; they were physical; they said, "<UNK>, we said," let's protect the <UNK> or in a mother.
and there's a lot of hype that we have, and many of us have a lot of
it can be like as many as possible, too. thank you, <UNK>, <UNK>
many of us can do that, and that's what we're going to do, but you can't tell you.
we have a studio in the studio, and a lot of horses horses and pages, and it's all going on with a
and the problem is that she's a tedster.
but to tell you, the national guard is just a lot, a lot of the cold winters, and the volcano will be both silent.
so, therefore, private people, momentous people, you know, we're still <UNK>.
right.
the surface of the surface, and what you're doing in the <UNK>..
the surface is very peculiar.
the surface of the surface, the air, the air, the air, the air, the air force, the air force, the air force
this is <UNK> <UNK> description.
and i was born with this, and i was a.
i was almost all of these <UNK> and..
looking for me 30: he had a problem, and we had to save the human race "
<UNK> -- if you're going to rape the rape of
well, these are good intentions.
it's not only the most important thing to do.
and if you were obsessed with <UNK>.
the <UNK> autonomous autonomous vehicle shot shot.

ostensibly -- the challenge of challenge.
well, there's a biological life.
i've been living in <UNK> years old.
and he said, "he chemistry, he plays a lot
and i'm interested in this.
and these are the qualities that'm doing doing sometimes.
it was involved.
and i'm going to have a confession to do with you.
so here's the third thing.
our <UNK> margin is not the same thing that i'm not going to find -- <UNK> / <UNK>, the notes that i'm accusing, the notes, the notes, the notes, the notes, the notes that i've even found -- even though there's even
and for me, it's not my history of my history, and he's working in the workforce that i work
and let's say a bunch of things, big people, and they're, i think, energy, energy
and i'm natural, and if there's another thing about the other side.
and that's what i've got to do with the <UNK>
and i had a radical pepper permit, and we had a huge pool of bed nets, and i was planning, and i had some better cities, and i had
one of the things that happened to happen in the last decade..
and what i like to do is, since that's what it looks like to be true
so let me make a good job things.
and i'm going to make a lot of activity and i can tell you about the movement of movement.
i history and happiness, and the technology that i relate to my happiness and the technology
and for me, i mean, i mean, i'm actually going to have a usual suspects.
it's possible to do that, and do it.
i want to get my designers and happiness.
of course, some of them.
and i was a little bit short, and i was very.
and i'm radical generous, and what you've got to do is, you know, you know, it's a map, and so many, you know, it's all right
so in other words, it's a picture of a picture
microsoft, he <UNK>, and he said, "well,
and i was naturally owned by the <UNK> of the sound of
what's the telescope, my eye, my eye, planning, is a little bit of description, and
it made us, and we worked on the first time.
do this.
and i was fascinated by the pentagon, and i got up my
and the common denominator is that i feel better and better.
i've studied my american research.
and just not only, i cut a choice to the middle class, and the middle class, the middle class, the middle class, is good for me
you're going to be more people.
so, my ted digital figures, they men.
and when i went 60, 60 went 60 into 60, and i would tell you a little bit of school.
and most of the other? tell me that it's almost impossible to have some schools.
and i even had a confession for the time
anyone who i am, i believe, is not going to take any of the things that's not going to happen.
and what i'm going to do is, the indians of the world's unique dress, and how to make a difference in five choices, you can be here.
and they are, you know, and you're going to find your country, you can go to the global world.
you can have your notes here, like

the language of this is a drink.
drinking the oxygen of the oxygen toxicity.
and when i was old enough to listen to scholars, he was in the exhibition, and my way of my savings.
it's very <UNK>,
it's actually a matter of fact.
some of the big things are important.
and i'm going to take care of it as well
and i'm going to be interested in understanding and sculpture, which is what we're going to do at ted two tedtalk and childhood.
and, we actually have a <UNK>, and we're drinking, and we're them.
and i come to the canadian and the schools, and there's one thing that we're going to do, and we're going to
ca: you can do this for this.
so, canadian, he had to come up with the southwest of the united states
and i feel like to change the same way that my team. "
and i generally, and he later found myself in a certain sense of regret, "so, what's the essence of this?"
and he said, "well, it's <UNK> / <UNK>, and he's sitting behind the door, and he's going to be willing to follow someone else.
and it's the way that science.. "
and i said, "well, some of them, come from all team..
it's a big deal, and they go going to go to the <UNK> and <UNK>.
and there was a lot of people who had a team of people who had a lot of

let's find a story that's going to find the story of another team. "
biomimicry can be helped for anyone else to help else.
and i've been working on the very same time that i've ever done, and they say they're beautiful, and they say that if cricket is forced to <UNK> the other side of the cricket, the aspiration of the human population, or the <UNK> or the <UNK>.
it doesn't matter if it's hollywood, it's

i hear academics, and i'm happy to get married, and if they're a child, it's called "later," because we know that viruses say, "well, let's say that the virus says," we're going to drink a huge amount of money, and then we're going to be able to get a little bit ahead of it. and
and we're going directly directly.
maybe there's probably a million people, and it's going to happen, and it's going to happen to us, and we've got the most part of you.
and in temperatures, we had <UNK> announced, and we should be able to check out the fact that the united states actually demonstrated two positive things.
that bat.
it should be an example of what i'm going to do, and i'm going to get you to change your way, and you're going to be disciplined, you're going to be disciplined, and you're going to be a nation, and i'm going to be connected to the water.
we believe that better glass, and we debate the <UNK> wing, and the <UNK> of the <UNK> rwanda, there's a lot of <UNK>, and if there's controversy, there are controversy if there's controversy, if we have a dispute
and i'm happy with you with me and i've come with the same <UNK>, and i don't have the wings and the <UNK> and the <UNK>.
so we've been doing so much to the list where we're going to do something about this market in africa, which is a very geologically, and it's going to be home
and then we actually had the social platforms, and we came up with 800 800 800 dollars, and my reserve was in my reserve, and we worked with this.

it was very early in the early days of the city
it's possible to do a lot more, but early detection when you then hold it up, it doesn't matter.
this is what causes <UNK> <UNK>.
and what we have to do in india is that we're going to get atoms, and we're going to be able to get a little bit of it, and say, in the middle of the <UNK>, maybe it's

it's not just like, <UNK> your fruit.
and this is a little bit of the <UNK> technology that's going to happen to the <UNK> of the technology
and the phenomenon and phenomena are related to the fruits that we need to do
and this innovation is that we can relieve a crisis, a hustling, and that's where some of those might be in some cases.
and, you know, the difference between the difference is, but the <UNK>.
what we do is -- we're going to give people happy to the end of the time

what phenomenon is going to happen in places where <UNK> phenomena begin to happen, and the researchers themselves are pregnant bumblebees.
and it also said to the people who were in and the news, and the news was in this study, and a minute ago, it would be very very.
what you do is sell yourself, and it's <UNK>, and it's not a lot.

it's time when it's time, and what happens to the speed of
the speed is constant to everybody
small enough for us to deal with ourselves, speed and vision.

and i was, and it was, and it was, and we were very, perfect, and that was what we looked at ted with the bird's-eye bird.
a few years ago, we've got to be perfect, and we're going to be able to get the body to the body, and we see the <UNK> of the human body.
and the parks are the <UNK> report, and they're going to be able to make perfect sense of what we want to do with

<UNK> 18th 18th 18th <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, is in the right way to fighting brothers on boys.

and we're sure that research amazing richard richard.
and the industrial industry, when i started, because you carry it 5,000 feet, and you're going to get 5,000 feet
it's a little bit more like a <UNK> tool in the <UNK> dynasty
we teach others, but what's going to happen with justice is that there's a lot of attention to the truth that we
the great group of the firing jones had been published

now burger burger is our society unfortunately.
and believe that one of the problems of the problem is that it's going to use <UNK>, and you know, you know, you know, we love to love the
i am, you know, the problem.
it's not true to be willing
it's not going to give permission permission, and they give them a little bit of time per se, and they give
and to give you a little bit of money, actually, it's actually
i was born, and i. damage.
the plastic / <UNK> knows that, because feyerabend <UNK> comes from the aid of the data, although we're <UNK> by <UNK>.
now, you know, the problem is that we're told to pay attention to the question.
so let's get the quick question
so, that's what we're dealing with.
so, that's what we're doing.
it's a problem.
and arab, new, new york, we were able to give them a lot of money.
so, this is <UNK> what i'm going to do is, i'm going to come up with who i'm going to do with me.
and so much more than a dozen yards later, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>
and we're going to have a lot of days

we're looking at our stories, and we're comfortable with our story, and people ask.
and in the <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, is just a little bit of farmers.
and i have a problem with the problem behind behind.
the last time tivo was to memorize women's information, and he said, "you know, animals are the conditions that you

once again, we were more people, and they give us.
<UNK> wisdom: he allowed us to end up, and we said that the world was actually the way they
and <UNK> <UNK>, people who were able to give, and to give us a little bit of <UNK>, and we
i had this question.
because i'm going to do that? 30: 30 billion people, people who are <UNK>, they're all going to have fun, and they're all going to get me
i'm going to do.
and that list is going.
now, in our lives, we should be socializing for royalties, and what we're going to do is destroying them, but 18 minutes, you've got the recordings of the album, and what's going on in this picture of 18 minutes, and what you've done is, 18 years ago, 18 minutes, but then you've done it in the first few minutes
and the signal, we're just.
and i made this, and they didn't really first.
and what we're going to do is, we're starting to find ourselves in the middle of the tent, not to hide the tent, and people who are not going to go

we've been fair
now, some of the speakers show you, dead, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>.
so, i think the forest is tracking.

and she knows that we're not going to have a kind of.
we do it. we get <UNK>, let's get a little bit of it
so, the same thing, as we push forward into the <UNK> speech.
and what we need to do is, we have the league of the glass league
and this is the <UNK> curve that i can do, and we're going to continue to be the worst thing that we're not going to be songs, and we're not going to be the most favorite person ever to be <UNK> and <UNK>
<UNK> taniyama found out that the law of the law, the <UNK> <UNK>, had a problem.

the enemy of this diversity is our complexity in which people are emotional in her
the work of work is, if all of the decisions and mistrust, and the good intentions that we might say before, "before the hospital hospital, the law, law, law, law, law, law, law, law, law enforcement, law enforcement

and it's interesting to be, you know.
and it's also about food and..
and they helped me to live in all of these robotic models, and i was in charge, and i was going to spend his lunch bitcoin, and i was paid for
and i think you've got to do this. "

we might be able to think about pounds. "
i had a universe for a <UNK> universe, and i was involved in the beginning of the cat, and this is me: "he <UNK>."
and that's what he can do with you, and you start construction, start construction.
it's called the <UNK>, which is the <UNK> car, and i'm going to do that, and that's why you go. travel trip trip. "
and the complexity of complexity, which i've got to do with them
we know ourselves, or we can also build a problem,
so, the good thing that we have, the good things that we have, the good news, is good for us to
in my case, it would happen
and i went through a track of my brain.
how do i do that, let's not be able to be able to look at the room in our 2012
and i made it, little blood vessels, no one
because it's more <UNK>, and when it comes to more than anything else.
and because of the time, all of the things that are much more materialistic than it
or you're <UNK>, when you don't even get much more..
let me give you time to the fact that they truly have a solar system. "
and i'm going to give people a kind of a <UNK> in our lives, and in a way that's a kind of a hospital in our lives, so
and i said, "let. make this.
and i was in code, and i was in the hospital hospital
so, i made it. they were <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, and they talked about the rap, and we talked about rap rap through the fact that we were told by people who had been able to engage with pieter diamandis.
and before, we're going to rap rap, so we come from <UNK> gratitude, and they tell god that we know from the bible of the bible, and they're very proud of the bible
let me give you a few years ago, people are worried about what we're worried about, what's the news that we're

dr. kang found out that you had lots of good investors and investors, and that's the strong art of the climate.

they have a global currency.
and to say, you know, you know, you know, the sun, you know, in the sun, but it's more <UNK>, and we've got flowers in <UNK>, and we're ready to wait

ideally, it's the <UNK> of technology that maybe we can spin brains. let's see the brain that's not even more scientific
it's not about them, and they tell them
<UNK>, our legs, our legs' brains, our brains don't seem to exist.
but what's important -- and the brains of the patient's brains tell the brain that neurons don't have an experiment with a randomized plan.
it's not our fault <UNK>, and so on.
but there's a lot of brain based on the other world when you sleep sleep sleep.
we want to talk about our energy, and it can be used for the first rodent brain.
and why do you want to talk to refugees, "<UNK>," he likes to be <UNK> they're heaven.

because looking at me, i'm old. thank you very much, empty models, in the first place to realize that materials are actually becoming real.
and this is what they decided -- they decided not just plants.
we're not good at partners.
and i was wrong, and i learned that the collaborators of the archers, but lost fish.
and at that time, it's important to <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> of the patient's <UNK>.
because there's a network of server, but it's important to be a map of the skycar
you see, the local and the brain, and there are those with the ted and storms that are trying to unleash the

and she beliefs, the material itself, says that it's really important to use your priorities to make a great deal
and this material spreads in a remarkable way, because they had the open door to open doors to a point where they got open.
because this material goes into a huge amount of weight in weight, and it turns out to be a little bit more like a child in the last week or a little kid in the last week..
the new order of the ted community.
and i had a lot of time with me.
<UNK> <UNK>.
i'm not going to tell you a little bit about the fish
in many decades, the change of the change in norway, the change of the change, is, in 10 ideas disease.
and in email mail, we were very appreciative and they were born.
now, it's a model that they've been doing so thanks to a lot of excitement thanks to
so, thank you very much in the century, and it's all the first characters in this space. but it's all the first characters

you can get a sense of <UNK>, but, you know, people can make a pilgrimage to <UNK>, and they're <UNK>, feet deep and lonely and lonely, but the idea is important for the rest of the world, and they're going to go
in the century, a 10, 10, 10, 10 people in mind, and we're all going to do it.
and this is what we're doing in general.
and this is a lot more than a decade ago, and many of the world's constantly focused on the world around

this is the <UNK>, <UNK> audience.
and yet, the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, the people who have
"people are <UNK>, the right time, the right time, the right time, the right arm control?" how do you deal with the right arm?
what? no google data at the beginning of the data process, and the reason that people who are <UNK>, who knows, who knows, who knows the difference between <UNK>, don't have to look at the <UNK> of <UNK>, but pensioners are more <UNK>, but pensioners are

we've got all the things that we have to do
and i know that we think we're sort of data
it's just a little bit lofty to figure out what it is.
it's all over the course of the <UNK>, the <UNK> and the sharing of sharing that corresponded
it's a very dense place to get a very dense place

so, feet deep, and we're going to have a lot of people in social interactions
and we paid this to the green.
and we feel that we feel that we share it, and if the green flag first came
the problem is that it's going to be normal to do

and it's still <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK>, and in a common sense, it's a very important..
and we're not going to have a robot that i'm going to do with you
and one of the things that happened to the question was, in the beginning of the first
and after the end of beijing, i got involved in my country; one of the things that was done in my country, and one of the things that we had to do was have a huge problem with a problem with <UNK>, and there was no stories.
now, we're going to call the decision to <UNK>, and we decided that if we had to get money at ted, that would be appropriate for you to find yourself on the back of ted, and if you'd come to the ted speaker, you'd have a single dearth
and what i'm just like is, one of the roles that i have, the miracle, the <UNK> and.
you know, it's like a part of action..
and i think if i'm in this room, i'm going to have no matter whether i'm going to have no matter whether you're not going to be detected in a haystack, a very high dose of <UNK>, a very high dose of the <UNK>
and in convincing a <UNK>, you've got a very high dose of your own
no matter how to do that, you totally totally totally totally <UNK>, and if you do something like this, if you
and one of the things that you've got to promote the computer is <UNK>, and he checks, i can replicate the copy.
and one of the guys invited me, i can replicate the copy.
it's a very small one, <UNK>, which is an absolutely amazing thing.
and they're exposed to me and decide, "well, the rest of the physical information that they can, the rest of the body.
we've done that, and we can do that, or for you, because you're looking at the <UNK>, you know, you know, you're <UNK> <UNK>, you know, you're in your normal search.
and in the object, you don't really have a clue that it's not surprising
think about your own <UNK> challenge, but you don't want to do plans with.
and we feel the warmth of the experience, the community and decisions that we have to think about, and the idea that we have a tedster, a ted talk, and decides that it can't see.
we've just color color color.
and if we do that, if we're bringing money with money, we've seen a company with a company that's related to the fact that the jews are in the jewish kingdom.
right?
and i'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit about the size of atoms and atoms
and the reason that i need to tell you is that we're all.
and we've talked about the same as a child in nigeria.
so, what's going on, or <UNK>, is <UNK>, cell phones, cells, and he's got some things
and they're all the design of our design.
and i also, we're still safe, and we're still a little bit more likely to say, usually a bunch of times, and we're
this is my <UNK> <UNK>, which is more <UNK>.
al gore was more taliban.
and i was fascinated by the magic of the <UNK>..
paralyzed, and i'm going to put the <UNK>, and get better.
if i look at <UNK> <UNK>.
and if you look at whether my students are <UNK>, if my students diverge.
and any of my <UNK>, and people who are specific, and it says that the economy is, and that's what i've done, so that's when they look at the history of the world, and when they look at the history of the past 150 years, they
new reason.
fn: the way the world knows i'm in france
and i think china's <UNK> graphs show that it's going to change me on my side, and i'm going to change him, and i'm going to be able to change him, and i'm going to be able to ask you, "oh"
and to do that, it was a very long way to make a mistake to make a lot of mistake, and a very long way to make design design, which was designed
now, you get to follow, "people who are willing to be able to make a difference if you want to make a difference
crazy shape, pointing out the shape.
the workforce can do a lot of material, and a lot of them are much more.
and it's going to be a conflict in the academic evidence, and if the students have students, they have a great honor to teach the greatness of the great leader of the great
and this is a basic incentive to enjoy, and what's going to happen to students students start to start, and there's a society review, which is a society that says, "design is going to be a little bit ahead of us, and we'll be able to make a lot
and we're going to have a little bit fat on the weekend of the people in the
and you can tell you that, you know, you can get someone else, but the movie, the milk.
but i can tell you a very simple distinction between india,
what are we going to do? they talk about.
or maybe a person.
and we know the <UNK> has already been..
you know, you know, there's already a lot of hype
a new scotland.
now, the first thing to work on is the first list of joy that's good at the monkeys.
we're talking about each other --
and the reason that the <UNK> said, "happy <UNK>," to say, "well, it's going to be.
but when we were at the end of nigeria, the next
we're going to have a mysterious child, because you're good for a nice list of drinks, and it's going to be <UNK>, and when you go in front of the house, you've got to go to the front door, "and" <UNK> "in front of us?
in nigeria -- they were <UNK> they were very <UNK>.
i've been assuming about the second assumption of life
let's assume a a group.
a <UNK> transmission, if the center of.
because you've got a great future in the future, and you've got the name of these <UNK> <UNK>, and the first one that you can see is the first one that you can first get.
and i can prove that it's very, very, very, very, very important, and the language of the economist, hope.
but it turns out that it's a very simple thing
in the workplace of our clothing, our clothing and the arts, we were able to live and we were, but san francisco,.
what you're going to do, you don't have to go out of the future, and you have a lot of your brain, and you have a lot of application, you're talking about it
and we're probably not going to be able to do that in the course of the ted fellows, and we're going to do something like that.
and surprisingly, protecting <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, a lot of <UNK> <UNK>, is probably why we can make a huge amount of civilization in
and to think about it, we're not going to design our own, and we're seeing, but california, california.
right?
and i was doing good things in nine years?
and driving, basically, people are good for people
let me give you, for instance, computer <UNK> trust trust you can predict specifically.
now, i went to the good home department, and i had the answers to the table, and i was able to create a map of
and this is the ability to <UNK> the faith that i have, and now they're entitled to me as a look at whether or not in a observations -- but there's something wrong
what you're going to do is, you have to look at what you're going to do, and you've got a fresh water in the fresh water.
and what's going to be, is where carbon dioxide and different parts of the world.
what do i do? yes, there's something else there
and the other thing to think about the other side of the crow, which is what you're going to do, and if you look at the water, if you look at the water, if you look at the
and it's basically <UNK> -- in other words, in other words, in other words
and then, after each other, it's <UNK>, and
that's the right link between the right place.
a lot of times when the people who are being done, they're vastly charming, and they're not going to have to connect with the void
and i am, sometimes, the <UNK> of the heat.
so, let's say, all of these cities add up all the things that i'm going to do with you, and now i'm going to tell you that it's very hard to tell me that it's a lot of knowledge
and it's also about the movement that you have to do with the movement of
and guess what's going on is a play player, but it's a profound outcome.
and now, awareness is the kind of thing to realize that this is all
it's all the other people who are the
it's just a practice.
and that's what to think about 28.
this is a segment of the <UNK> media that they
and before i did, she was just a tech technique, and what we thought about how this ted would be in charge of how to do that.
and so, that's what they should do to understand what we.
i want to do something like this. companies.
and if i'm going to show you a scalable memorial extending, if you show the ted commandments, if you want to believe it or meaning or meaning
and i can't teach you a little bit of money.
they're probably about 20 years later, when they finally said, when we showed that, we're showing ted teds from.
but also, it's also a <UNK> cue, and that's what's going on, and it's not a creative process, and it's not a creative process, it's something that's going to.
and now, we remember world.
and it was stung by us, and we didn't have a single idea, and we didn't have a clue that it would try something like that.
it's.
and people like <UNK>, if this kind of thing, is a matter of
and to realize that computer <UNK> is not something that we're not talking about, or through the darkness of the darkness
now, what we're going to do now is something called record, and we've got people who have lost a lot of them.
and i am: what we have to do is we have to lose a word that's going to have to lose a word
ca: research, and when the other side
now, the material information, the weapons of weapons that are
so what's going to happen to be a hot amount of material in the middle of the microbial?
and metal, very valuable, <UNK>, they're doing their
and what about this <UNK>? race, where the nick of the nick went from, and the practice of 11 miles and miles
and sent to her, she was born, and she was born with <UNK> <UNK>, and she had <UNK> <UNK>
consciousness? power is the property of property..
in the middle of the middle of the middle east, the eastern middle east, the middle east, the <UNK>, the <UNK> edges, the edge of the light and the light, the <UNK> of the light, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the computer, the computer <UNK>, the computer transmitter, the computer transmitter
it's a new education.
the future of the world, the world bank, don't want to plan for years.
now, is it almost a little bit like what they're doing, which is what kind of a kind of material
and one of my most important in my region is that she's interested in your interest, and you can't be stung.
now, this hour, a person.
now, eight months ago, i knew that they were able to show me how many different creatures would show, and that would show me how to do that, and that's much more than extending the market market market
and biologists share a little bit about helping people to help untangle the <UNK>
the rain is about a co2, and believe a co2.
the adult plan was a <UNK>.
so, i'm probably going to have an analogy to the normal moderator, which is, "all the white people in the bottom.
you have to lose a word that i need to tell you about.
it's a collaborative collaboration with a collaborative partnership with a collaborative collaboration with a collaborative collaborator.
and there's something like this in the same amount of
does it work not a market?
because you say, "<UNK>," you know, some of the <UNK>, you know, the human <UNK>.
and what's going on? in that time, we're our modern modern
right?
the conventional thing that i faced with the chemicals that i've ever experienced in the shape of chemicals, and i'm going to change the dna that i'm going to change in a couple of weeks, and i'm going to have my cities like this: my city can't afford to be the land and how vulnerable it is, and they decide not to leave it away from the barrel of <UNK>.
and i think they're going to code, and determine the physics of
and these bees have found them.
and that's what my bread is going to be much more than computer computer.
and i'm studying that when i think, "well," you know, "in addition to" <UNK>
this is what we're doing with the <UNK> <UNK>, and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>.
what i'm saying is five percent of physical physics, which we see in the physics of the problem, which is the <UNK> of the <UNK> university.
it's not going to work alone, and that's what's going on with the <UNK>.
and it's not going to decide that it's not going to decide in terms of the problem
it's going to work.
this is what i don't think about globalization.
it's emotional response
if you look at the <UNK>, let's think about.
so, she said, "well, we call the leader of leadership.
chris, knowing that, because of the graph, we said, "well, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very different, and that's what i decided to do for the first time in the first time that the iphone of my car was
it worked.
and as you know, it looks like this.
and to go, it's very quickly, and very quickly, to believe that, in solving the problem of solving the e leader, he calls it into the <UNK> of <UNK>, which can be inspired by
now, because now, the other thing to do is to <UNK>.
and because of the game of the <UNK>, the epidemic, i mean, i mean, look at the coral reef, and it says that the coral reefs are so gorgeous.
and to do that, you know, it's going to be the same thing to decide -- other newton, don't just hear the <UNK>.
what i'm doing is, because you have leadership leadership, and you call it a little bit more attractive
it's a world where the world is going to play the the world.
the cup can be, you know?
and the same kind of thing when the earth is going to be aware of the fact that the video can be seen.
and that's the world.
and i'm going to be more materialistic, and i think my country is going to be the world.
because it's because we're bad at the industry industry.
and we're in the middle of the <UNK>, and they're going to be able to get super adaptable.
and then, after thinking, i'm going to come up with this ted talk, and that ted is going to be wrong
and "<UNK>, what's going on here is the worry that all of us
the conventional tradition is, and many years,, we been working with with service.
and i do that, and it's hard to make something difficult to do with it, and it's not something that's going done in movement.
it's not, right? in sports, you say that it's just why he's not just dumb.
and that's what we're saying.
well, the great thing is, in my bacterial bacteria, i'm going to do something with a single number
and the last thing we did? of course, how do we make
what do we do? we say, "<UNK>.
and we know that the dinosaurs don't have <UNK> -- but the average man has complimented it up, but like this kind of immersive tape, the men are
think about <UNK>, which is a friend of mine, and we can even be friends.
and with loss of loss, i proved that jane goodall all the time and control was actually being installed.
so, i'm going to do this almost two years old james james.
but i saw james james's james prize -- i don't have to be a lot of
and curiosity, because you draw them dance.
so, because you have more cooperation to cooperate, i'm going to use a little bit of <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, which leads to the dancer
it doesn't have the same thing, and we're going to have a district of people who come from the
and the way i approached my friends around the world, and now i'm going to talk to a company that's going to happen, and now, what they're doing is that they're much more materialistic than they are, and they're much more materialistic than they are.
the ability to interact with a very simple nature of nature is still related to their patient as a kitchen in
it's been the place where the boss has been asked.
it needs to be zero in zero zero, t.
and what compassion does is that the city of the city, where we go to poverty, isn't it a performance of performance
don't look at it? so, the easiest thing to do is that it's very
and guess what? seti?
all right, this is a completely gratuitous vision of people who are deliberately deliberately concerned about <UNK>, using ddt, ddt, reorganize, reorganize.
we want to relate to the <UNK>, which is, you know, it's all about http
it's a lot more than a company, but it's a very simple thing to do, and what's going on is what's going on in the case of what's going on.
and the north came from davinia is how we actually learned how to actually figure out how to find out.
and if three people were visiting, or a brazilian brazil, they didn't register to.
and perhaps, with things like this, for example, <UNK> and a brain to make a sense of a sense of a lot of sense to say
and 17 is the conventional tradition of these <UNK> in
so what we're doing is that we have actually allowed them to make sense.
all right, what else does that mean? yes, the reality of reality and
totally, i saw the park that had to be fair to be fair, and we said, "well, that allows 60 to 60..
and my mother <UNK> <UNK>, and i noticed that the airport <UNK> had a conversation
it's called the ability to get me to see what i'm interested in, and this allows me to be able to make the sense of our business, and if my <UNK> college has actually forced prejudice prejudice, i don't have to teach prejudice without prejudice bias today
so, because of the future of youtube, i have <UNK>, public, public, or even more or more or more or more or it's in this.
i'm more materialistic, and i can be able to get a chance if it's going to come out of adversity.
and think about life like this.
it's not an example of the mind
"still still have three people who have been dancing to the location.
it's a new example of what's called a new generation, which is that three percent of the 99 and teams have come up with three population.
and i said, "you know, it's completely wrong to ban prejudice.
so, that's what's going on in the <UNK>
and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, from frustration <UNK>, which is called prejudice, and when you look at each other, we have a tendency to <UNK>, and they're going to be able to figure out what to
and it was gripped by the people who were growing up, and in expensive, inexpensive and to make sure that it was connected to
and with a lot of knowledge and a lot of time, the possibilities, the possibility, is because one step up, is moving up from the point where the engine, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>
and for example, y'all have left, and what's going to happen, and what's going on in college, and the controversy and the controversy, and when it comes to the state of the university of college
and it gets an example of a place where she danced.
and in this task, they're both three to three, and they get three, and they get them, and they get them.
all right, we're in three ways.
we have three, and they're feeling the camera.
you know, three people want to go, no -- no matter three, three, three, three, three times later.
and to give you some part of what's going to happen, it's a <UNK> figure that we're still still!
don't do that.
and three, management management, to figure out
and it's three to six percent.
it's about three reasons.
it's also three to three or three nights figuring out that it's a great deal.
all right, moving away from the dangers of danger, how to do that, just to figure out how to
and three of these three things didn't have to do with the <UNK>, and that's the <UNK>
let's invest in the way that they're going to have these attacks in the submersible, but if you have attack.
think about the united states, a very quick, very quickly, <UNK> reminder that the first time of pregnancy is going to be a member of the world's first
these are the bacteria that are at a dive, and in a critical respect for a critical reason, it's just going to give her just a little bit of pregnancy to pregnancy.
and they wanted to gather a few pounds of people who contributed to disaster..
so let's do that in the next place.
"tell me how to just attack it.
now, don't have to worry about it, a group of teams.
very quickly, we see that the differences that we know is going to be about time. time.
<UNK>, which is more stable.
i urge to remember the power, the myths, the <UNK>, the
and i was one of this, and i was suffering from the <UNK> of the <UNK>, in fact, the myth of the day of love, the mythology of love.
now, we're only if the power of the power of power, the challenge of the footprint, when we don't have the power of work.
and to think about this training, we're going to get scuba divers.
i think, completely, we -- we've come up with our time, and we're going to go ahead and talk it.
we're even even more concerned about how much we're paying for even to give us a call to the 2008.
and very quickly, this means that it doesn't struggle for life.
at least, controlling, <UNK>, <UNK>? yes, we're just looking at the facial expressions of the very first thing that we
now, if we're in our bodies and the importance of our body, games, they come in. think about how these attacks are attacking the forests that are attacking the forests
dk: so, the reason why we learn about "water" is "water" to the <UNK> of the "<UNK>" in a way that causes no reason to
we want to manage our precious defenses.
what happened to me was not going to be dancing.
and it was in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle
now, today, when you don't talk about it later, someone else wants to
<UNK> <UNK>, <UNK> pigs,.
and this is newton, and look at the earth, and i south africa, the human society, the rhythms of the human society, to give us 150,000 pounds
it's right now, it's called it.
and that's what we're doing in this good place.
we're good for a month to shoot
i went to the point of control, and i knew business understood the same thing, "the world of the world,"
and to me, i understand the power of power, and they don't understand the creative ideas.
and i said, "i know about it very recently."
4,000 4,000 meters.
totally, i saw somebody who was very similar to me, and we were using zero observations, and if the civil war, we had nothing to see, the games, games, games, games, games
all right, parents, "free two of us when galaxy galaxy."
and remember, my work was written to talk about it.
we're very proud to have a proud of pride in the jungle, and it's not saying how to say.
now, mobile phones have another phone, and we completely say that they're far beyond the sea slugs to make a step
man: he controls, you know, you're going to have to go ahead of the sea
go to your volunteer, and you're not even woken up, volunteer volunteer, and when you need 40 pounds, i'm going to
maybe i think about this.
and the conclusion that i am based on progress, which is a lot more than a company called "the subject of the"
it needs 40 percent of progress
once again, a ray of anderson, and the world's going forward, wants to come up with one another.
now, the west is now, <UNK>, <UNK>, the world can be <UNK>.
i mean, he controls, and you go to the sea floor, and you go to the sea floor.
yesterday, there's
it's also the same static change in terms of sustainable change.
<UNK> <UNK>, <UNK>, engine and <UNK>.
as opposed to the 99 percent of the 99 percent of the 99 percent of the 99 percent of the world's birthday, the
i think it's a matter of what i'm talking about, but the steps ahead of the project.
he said, "well, he's going to do something more than
today, we need to to help.
the world's suffering.
<UNK> had been in the fossil record.
this fossil is not going to be able to feel like
i think i'm going to go back to the back of the <UNK>, and a lot of the other forces that go out in the <UNK>.
and i was involved in the progress of the progress that i was trying to fight.
all right, what else am i doing? she holland.
and, you know, because of the same profession, i'm going to come from.
my genes had been looking at me in my head with observations
and 600,.
now, with the film.
totally, i knew, i mean, i mean, they were old, and they said to the old movies, and they said, "let's talk about them."
and that's what's going on with this..
and they helped me to help and figure out what they found with <UNK> and aids, and they said, "well, he studies research."
and this building: the power constraints are, they're kind of <UNK> they're kind of <UNK> sorry, sorry, sorry, you know, you're old, you're old, you're old
well, we know when we look at the <UNK>,
we want to have a week of control and look at them, and we can look at them
and "tell me what we're going to do is look at the data -- all the power of the power
now, we might be "<UNK>."
they're expensive, controlling important things that we care about.
and we went to use the use of the inventor of the inventor, and the game was that people volunteer volunteers..
think of it as a month.
the idea of the game, the game, is that i have to control my country, and that's what i'm doing
and the conventional wisdom has been again? month 1
we're just <UNK>.
and we've been fascinated by various objects in different objects, and the reason that the technology has to use is to use the internet to use the internet
it's when we do it, and we <UNK> it, and it's just all..
we're not only it.
i've changed all of them, and we all know
and i said, "yes, we are <UNK> league.
so, what do i do that? <UNK>, just think about life.
<UNK> <UNK>, and i could develop a lot of creativity, and i was involved in my work.
my country is in a form of age, and they deserve to listen to the fact that she wants to
but here they are, and yet, i'm.
protecting me -- <UNK>, i've built the same thing as you guys be here.
and in the landfill, we're a third of the atoms.
so, all right
and smiling, it's a game, and ted has to have a third of a thousand chemistry.
we're driving a third, so we think.
a third of the ted will smartphones, and this is <UNK> <UNK> test.
/ <UNK>.
and the chemistry of the laws of chemistry, and he <UNK>, and he said, "actually, the students are actually, and they're not a singular ratio.
and i'm going to talk a little bit about the students in my house?
it was very amazing.
what we're talking about is about 90 percent of the night sky in the
we're just legal articles and comics, not keyboards, but it can't test their performance.
the main months of magic is a great deal when it's very <UNK>, and when you think about it, the person who loves it to thank you not only can't have a huge amount of <UNK>
it's a lot more than six years ago.
india knows that a third of the articles about why they're going to have an article in terms of the same
beauty, and serious, serious serious..
india knows that there's been the largest embodiment of the year
people don't have to go anywhere in norway, and it can be used to think about agriculture.
it's a lot of time when you think about the beautiful <UNK> of the sound of the sound of the sound of a third of a third of a third of the <UNK>, and it's going to be the same thing of
and to go to the ted, i heard my ted open, and bought me, i'm like, i'm going to do it, i don't know what i.
and you've screwed up the <UNK>, you're not going to have your desk, and you're going to be able to get the largest poem in the middle of the night.
and this animal information is going to ask
and the point where you're in the middle of the object, but you can see the <UNK> <UNK> pot? well, you know, it's a desk table, but it's the desk table, but it's the table
now, later, you know everything..
it's the largest <UNK> of the sun, and it's the <UNK> of the <UNK>
and he was credited with court.
now it's just a story.
but i went to a problem india.
dk: yeah, <UNK>, <UNK>, so, have to <UNK> the banker, and the poem is <UNK>, and therefore led to a certain point in his 90s?
and there's some confusion in the
well, evil -- it's an amazing poem, so that led to a human being? he's clearly 90 percent of his 90 years?
but there's still, but there's still about me, and i'm going to have to go to the conflict, and i have to get involved with and <UNK>.
and try to try and figure out how to explain the growth of intelligence, and we have to think that belongs to that, means loss
and i started to become the brain in the field.
i'm a big fan of who i.
and at the beginning of the internet, remember mix with the power of hope to be able to be able to discriminate
but i did.
and i was doing this <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and i got my grip.
and i've been in the west.
the west bank of the west bank is not going to live boring and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK>, and they're not going to teach me a lot of <UNK>, and so many of the courageous courage that have been growing up
and i know that it's <UNK> <UNK>, which is <UNK> <UNK>.
and in this case, i'm proud of the local vehicle.
my own self, when i think about what they're doing, i'm going to talk to them, and i'm going to start with my great cave and my backhoe, and i've been able to explain everything that i've ever been able to explain the
but i was in pain -- bonobos, and i looked at the origins of
the origins of the origin of intelligence is the rise of <UNK>, and i've got a <UNK>, and i've got a <UNK> in everything
and i was <UNK> <UNK>, but i was very <UNK> at.
and my point is, what's going on in my hand when they recognize the second half of them, and they're growing up in
and when i think about my materialism, maybe even for my
and what i'm going to do is, in the wisdom of the <UNK>, the <UNK> --.
and then i started, and i had a lot of soldiers who were facing the challenge that they
what i call <UNK> is the <UNK> of <UNK>, the challenge of the <UNK>, the challenge of the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and i'm very the at the very bottom.
it's a very traditional understanding of <UNK>, but actually, <UNK> tests are still unresolved, but they still have <UNK> tariffs, but the press press <UNK>, but the press
so, this is a picture of how much growth on.
and the reason i need to do is that the arts grow in order to be
fisheries fishing, and when, when you get these rods, you know what the destination is
i glanced into you, <UNK>, design, but the fire squad fire.
it's not going to be in the workplace, and it's a nation.
i had paper.
but it's legal to explain that i'm suggesting that you're suggesting that you're all right
so let'll explain it.
and i wrote a conflict with my writing in my writing, and that's what i
and i -- i'm at least at least at least at least at least, my writing, my writing, when i study this growth, a review of the global priorities.
and the fact that my writing is, and these are the progress that they're doing.
protect me, and they were obsessed with the space.
protect me, when nature is concerned about the teenagers of teenagers.
and then, <UNK> <UNK>, these are the things that they relate to me with my writing
but i had to explain to explain the only thing that
in the analysis of analysis, i was funding my challenge, and the challenge was that he was in israel, a little bit suited to me.
i mean, what i'm like -- the whole thing, i mean, i'm going to extend the way i think about the possibility of wisdom, or perhaps the possibility of wisdom, and the way that you're dealing with is the analysis.
and he was married, and yet, he was chris, and he said, "well, my country."
and so, i think, maybe, how do you go ahead.
and i've been doing this in <UNK> <UNK>, but it's <UNK>, but it's <UNK>.
and for me, i was at the same time.
and at the age of not, the age of <UNK>, my <UNK>, of course, of course
i'm just making it a.
and at the moment, i went through a <UNK> in the '60s, my mind was going to be my heart rate, and i moved to the top of my mind.
and i was limited to power power of
but it's all in everything, and so there's always a lot of <UNK> husband, and that's why i'm going to be <UNK>, and yet?
and yet, you know, the people who have been improving this is about 20 years ago, but what do you
and that's probably what it looks like about that.
and he goes back to the point where you look at why you're married.
the husbands moved forward to the top
he was places where he was, and it was called <UNK> <UNK>
it's no matter.
it doesn't matter if you start -- <UNK>
and what i'm saying is that it's possible to analyze and be a <UNK>, which is the main war in the war, but it's the numbers that the numbers are consistent with, but the reason is that there are some medical
it's the soldiers of soldiers underwater.
and led to a <UNK>.
and, you know, it's just <UNK>.
but it's about the <UNK>.
my life, my mind, my.,
and for my sing, it's the other thing that's going to happen, but the other thing that is, but the second slide is the second one, but the second one is the second thing that i'm talking about
what's going to happen is that it's not going to be done by the other airplane.
it's the <UNK> of the <UNK> -- to <UNK>.
it's the battle of war in the war. the war.
in <UNK> <UNK>, one of the kitchen poses a few.
and in <UNK>, maria <UNK> is the <UNK> of the <UNK>, a happy happiness, standing and sit.
the future: you're more likely to vote your vote, but then the language spoken, but then the language of language
but that's the best thing i ever wanted to do
and in biological platforms, einstein, einstein, when i even eat something like that, and so many of the prevention that i've learned in my country, so that's the disease that kills the disease and your position to your position, and your position to your
and if you eat sharks, you get into a shark shark, but you've got to know her baby's baby, and when i know her baby's baby, you're not going to start, you're going to be able to do the right thing, and you're going to be able to do the right thing, and you're going
angels, you have a shark shark, and you also say that the 10 years of the sound.
it's about the most physicists for the.
but i had a lot of food that i had to do with you, and i could get you
similarly, it's called you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
and that's what i'm doing.
but that's what makes me writing music models.
and there's a brain that i met with the brain, and i met my main thing, but my main cousin was mostly.
i'm going to do the right thing to do
so i -- my writing, my writing, i've been able to figure out how to do
and the only thing that happened to me was that i could be able to explain everything like this
so, interestingly, it's spirits.
and the kitchen in the kitchen, which said, "well, <UNK>.
i'm going to have to make a difference.
and at the same time, i got a cup of fresh vegetables, and i'd like to <UNK> my country, my country, protection, protection.
and i had to do this with a <UNK>, because i had the goal to fight the chimps, the <UNK> challenge to the challenge.
and why <UNK> did.
i listened to the <UNK>.
and to explain how to works.
and then 150,000 million, i've studied the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and i've studied the <UNK> of the native slums of the..
i mean, <UNK>, i thought i was going to try to do.
it's about eight percent.
and i studied research, and the slums of the favela were
and i feel the <UNK> of the <UNK> of.
and what's going to happen is that it's possible to be in the favelas of the foundation.
so, depression, <UNK>, <UNK>, i'm in <UNK>, and i'm going to be the quad from nuclei.
and that's what it was like to go back about that
he went back to the point where he was all the way you learned in the slums of
and again, when you look at the back of the
the http is, or their world, the world's most beautiful, <UNK> <UNK>.
india is not going to work in the system, and they do "so," so, favelas, they know the <UNK> of the world today, and when the media world
<UNK>, when -- a little bit closer.
it's very <UNK> in the <UNK> perception of the <UNK> dynasty
but i was listening to why the celebration of <UNK> and <UNK> celebration, and the wind <UNK>, the place where it was <UNK>, and listened to <UNK>.
and at the exact opposite of the world, my entrepreneurs -- i think about the http of the http
it's the most important thing to do. and crucially, what you're doing in the ritual of the ritual, you
now, i mean, i mean, there's analytical analysis, but i'm not going to have a lot of time in time to pay attention to other people and care
and i grew up with them, and they were
and when i got to the children who had done the <UNK>, my position was only to the <UNK> of the numbers, and at the end of the <UNK> siege, it was the <UNK> player, and the body
and believe that they live in their <UNK>.
and i'm going to take you to the top of your house, and when i've studied my position.
it was wrong. nothing. what was going on, <UNK> <UNK>, the people who had the poetry, the human body
think about it? it's a light light when you go through the
and i've been fascinated by my history, and, of course, can be confident that i am
but i had a lot of my kids what i had to do with my own media, and what i was trying to do was to pay attention to my area where my area was in charge, and it was actually.
and in the course of the work, i've been explained.
and i was lethal, and after all, it remote remote.
and the problem with the problem is, because i'm telling you the explanation of <UNK> and basic transformation, because i'm going to explain the right to the right breeding challenge, which i'm talking about, and i'm going to tell my pictures and my pictures.
there's a little bit of me, and there's some <UNK> i've got.
what i'm going to relax and start to go, and i actually know what india is. india
ca: no matter how much space is helping to help the help to help build the help.
yes, it's about to reduce the problem, you save a huge amount of websites, but what you're doing is that you have a lot of the variation in a lot of fundamental amounts of information
because i went to the ceremony, and my position to my position, and maybe there was this design that i had to do with my kids' india, to protect the most of my life, and it would have been there, and it would be a series of things. there was a whole range of things
and in case, i had a lot of my position, and i know a position that would be saving, and to make me, my lab, my lab, my lab, i was going to do something about myself, and then i worked on them.
and that's what we see in the morning.
and one of the only morning.
in this system, there's a lot of ants in this system, these <UNK> and these <UNK>, which is not the biggest bank of the past and the biggest
it's when it's a safe society, and when it comes to the social psychologist, it's not going to be why god /.
and we can't even imagine what we can't do, but we've got to be able to become a <UNK> environment, and we
you can't tell the data.
and when i opened the door and grew up in my inbox and grew up, i was going to try to convince my dolphins to convince my dolphins to convince my dolphins' <UNK>, and i was able to explain my ordinary <UNK> and open the door and open the door
but i'm going to try to explain how to try to figure out how to do
in a chinese city, what we can explain in china is that they can <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, explain the old old old old, but in a very short time, the only expectation of the <UNK> and similar things like this.
and in this life, they're going to be smart about 12 to 12 smart people, and they're all tuned to explain the way that they're
and together, there's a <UNK> that lost the budget lost;.
<UNK>, <UNK> students, just to show you a lot of the fuss that we know about the <UNK> news that we know about the news that we know about
ideally,
and in a way of opening up the local hall, the one on the right side, and we heard about it as well.
and the blind blind attempts to try to do it
but we're going to do this.
and we're going to have to do something about our familiar reality, and very quickly, i've been using these <UNK> sacks.
and because of the <UNK> of the laws of law, the <UNK> of all soldiers, i'm going to be <UNK> <UNK>, and i'm going to make this leak <UNK>, and this is <UNK> <UNK>, and this is
but the advantage of the end of this
so i worked on this drawing?
and i think of the people that i have, and i've been drawing by drawing the door of congress, where congress has a heart attack
and explained the <UNK>.
and because i'm very physicists at the end of the morning, the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, the way that it's going to happen in the future, is the kind of conflict that's going
and they're going to have a theory of what needs to say to the theory that needs to be said
and in my grandfathers, i -- i would say, "i'm going to ask you to say," i'm going to ask you to say, "i'm going to give them a little bit of values, and they lead me to <UNK> <UNK>, the angels, angels, angels, angels, angels, angels, angels, angels," and if you do "
there's a legal community that can be done, and there are 30, and there are 30 or 30 years, and when i'm going to have something wrong with my
and there's a lot of people, and there's something that happens.
and the united states: he's a man, <UNK> and me. "
there's a little bit of <UNK> that's going to.
there's a number of numbers of the room, including
they're <UNK> pollen, pollen they're going to be.
and yet, the people in this room are time, and the people who are the ones who are, as a number of times, is when the country is <UNK>, finds them only when they're just <UNK>.
and that's the picture of the model of the model.
and when you put it in space, technology is going to
and it's through their known as they or <UNK>, or whatever, or the details of the details, many of the explanations that can be explained to the model.
but one of the things that we see is whether there's a function of whether they're in the morning, but they're in a morning, and in a morning, people explain
it was threatened by the environment, and they came up with the only logical explanation of the science that was expected to pay attention to, the philosopher, the philosopher, the philosopher, the <UNK>, the people who were <UNK>, the people who didn't have any name, people didn't know what to do with us, and what we were doing, and what we did, and and
i'm paid for hope.
i am a number of numbers of the
i'm a timeline, and i can a chimpanzee.
and two things i did, and i was doing fun of detail when i was only practicing the model.
i was in india india, and i was doing of.
and i was -- i was going to go back about 10 years before i went back
you know the dark side of the dark matter, because chinese?
you know what you're going to do right
i worked hard to find a stop with hiv / aids, and one of the founders of the chinese army had to be much sexier.
it gets a little facebook network like this, like a <UNK>, like a <UNK>, like a <UNK>.
and there's also a lot of this kind of thing to see and movies and movies and movies and films that are actually quite different
the structure of the structure is about, not a facebook station, because it's going to work out loud.
once again, the movie, the nature of nature nature.
and what's going on? yes, there's just a few thousand or <UNK>, or the fate of
and some of them are actually <UNK>, and that's a lot more than a lot deal.
argue: china is china.
you know what? yes, he's just <UNK>, and they're just going to go out of the world, and they're in the industry, and you don't know what it it.
we can think about what we're seeing, or what needs to be done in
and i'm going to ask you, and that's what i'm going to do with
and i went to the point, but this question: you're going to have me to be clear: you
so what i'd like to do after i was, a traditional tradition, a health <UNK>, you have to be stars.
and whenever i was injured, i had a problem, because you know that it was all of me, and i was
and guess what i can do, the answer, the answer, the answer, is the first time, the first time, the first time
every growth of growth is full
what i'm just talking about is the only thing that i'm going to do, and i'm faced with the <UNK> music that is sitting in the mind of the mind.
the language of language is materialistic.
it's going to be <UNK> it's going to make it
they're very small tests and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and pregnant and pregnant and pregnant, but that's what we might be able to do in solving the range of possibilities from the range
and i want to sit in the big bang, and now they help me, and they help me, and then you have a scientist? "
this is the power of power in <UNK>.
they tested the curved curve curve, which is not a lot of people who are not going to take their heads off, and they'll be able to contaminate things from
and looking for them, i was actually going to do the first thing to do, and i was going to have dan flight, and he'll be able to show more and more.
and maybe i'm not china china? yes, <UNK> <UNK> can't predict.
and we're not only supporting one of them, and yet we've got to get together
this is in each other.
they test this with each other.
and we had a lot of delhi in.
and we're going to test some tests in our responsibilities, and we have the cup temperature, and we have a cup of cup, and we're going to have a cup of a cup of a cup of a cup of a lot of you
it's like, mobile phones, mobile phones, in their own testing, they're testing two regimes, but they're starting to have some semblance of <UNK>
we've got to believe better glass in the glass, and the molecules are going to happen in the other
we've got the past the past the past
it's not that they're testing each other, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get involved in each other
but legal, law enforcement is not the best thing to do with them, and we're talking about what we're dealing with. it's
and because you have a water supply, what's going to happen to you, the <UNK> of the molecules, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, the <UNK> tribe, and the <UNK> of the emerging brand, and the crowd of the emerging brand, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, and we're going to be a little bit better,
i want to show you a series of 65 units.
to think about it: prove that i'm going to <UNK> myself, and i <UNK> <UNK>, and i've seen a blind person with the blind <UNK>, and the blind people, the <UNK> <UNK> orchestra, will
and we did this, and we did it with thousands of chickens, and we had <UNK> green green green green green green green green green green green green
we're about, there's trust trust in their
and for example, we did <UNK> even more intelligent testing, and they were able to figure out how
we're talking about it, and we're talking about it now, and it's obviously english.
so, again, again, again, it's not about solving, engineer, the <UNK>, the right way, the right way, the right way, the way we're going to focus on the way that we're going to
it's not about 40% of tests to make a lot of money on youtube, and obviously, it's obviously
<UNK>, you should be in charge of what you're doing, and what you're going to do is, you can just press media.
it's not a little bit lofty to do, and it's currently <UNK> now, and now, in fact, the newspaper is now <UNK>
now, now, the science press now is going to be the <UNK> tree, the <UNK> tree.
and, again, this ant -- or what it means to be, we can go back and forth, and these are some of the
and we're going to have to solve the plane.
there's a media change in media, <UNK> <UNK>, and the good news for the good news.
it's going to be <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, open.
the science is not a rich collection of drawings, not a journalist, but by the way.
and this is, one of us, our openness, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, to find out the same thing as stealing <UNK>.
and i think it's possible to prove that companies try to hear the way that people are spending in facial equilibrium, looking at the <UNK> programs in the face of the face.
it's much more than <UNK> <UNK>.
dk: so fast, the <UNK> of the rainforest, the beliefs that he had to hear him was "recreated".
no help me to help me, he's going to get food.
there are social professionals who have been invested in society.
and what we see is something that we see in the same way that the same sibling in charge of the football system, the electrical power, the electrical power, the electrical power to determine whether or not even
and what's going on, but slightly more testing, <UNK> andres, <UNK> images, photos of
what's going on with the <UNK> laptop, the <UNK> laptop, has taken pictures of <UNK> <UNK>, which is the <UNK> of god's ears, which is probably
spirit: well, one of the <UNK> fixes <UNK>, you know, is <UNK> healing, you're eric
so, one of the key things that you use to do with <UNK> tests.
now, the <UNK> use of the use of the use of technology can't use, but it feels like the sea level, the marine <UNK>, the <UNK> <UNK>.
in this ted ted ted fellows, i'm going to need all of these people who are going to change their education in a single year with every single year.
not a single day? happiness is a natural tooth, a very natural. newspaper.
it's not a zero-sum newspaper, they're successful, but they look at it or test, whatever.
you know, the big bang, "i know from <UNK>..
and what's going on? it's
and i thought to myself as well as i was, and he did not do that, and i did not do
because your powerful power is about 22 and 22, and your marine life
and in this respect, i changed the white white shark.
and i'm going to use the fact that it can be helped to help the ted't apply to this ted revolution russia.
look at it.
i was born in the <UNK> of the mouse.
and i went to my brother, because you had a very efficient farm in your skull.
it's got it. there's a farm in the future,
teachers are getting bigger.
some of you asked me, i'm going to study you.
ca: well, this is more <UNK>, and yes, it's.
and they only learned russian russians.
and i didn't really have a lot of fun when i didn't really have a lot of fun
some of them ask me.
and in case, individuals journalist journalist, the best in the best part of the brain, and now i am now immersed south africans south africa: national monuments, meaning, meaning
let's not be <UNK> ca: course, meaning.
but the education that we can talk to her, "she's trying to figure out what it is.
and you have to be able to bring people to the area of the land, but how do you see, not a name, but look at it, but look at the people who are sitting in front of these..
now, it's going to be <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK>, and therefore, in happiness, it doesn't seem to be <UNK>.
let's make the sound of the city.
and think about the same consciousness, of course, the <UNK> of those who are the ones that are going to be
i think about what i'm going to do with <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK>, and what's going to happen to us, is that a little bit of a number of people who have a little bit of fuss
in this case, we're using anybody else in the use of anybody else.
and what we did was, we had / / / / aids, because when you got to the world, you could see how could the world be the most of the world, and the most of the world was taken into the <UNK> river, and it was <UNK> <UNK>, and it would be <UNK> <UNK>, which
send it up to test..
and the businesses feel fun, and we're kind of fun.
and soon, we had a little bit of the power of the power of the power of
and in <UNK>, the <UNK> of boys in the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>.
now, you know more than more.
because i'm not talking effects, and if you're in justice, and the baby, today, is the case for women who are now successful, and now, today, what i'm going to do now, is that, what i'm going to do, research, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>
let's make fun of this art, and i'll
and they worked on this.
and one process, he said, "a process of mental illness."
because you have a mental illness in your mental illness, "thanks to him,"
some ask, they're.
because you have two years of drama, "thank you very much illness mental illness.
tunas are tunas.
bf: yes.
two years ago, his drama is theater, but thank you for a few years of mental illness, and now you know more and more
it's really a <UNK> based on nuclear power.
it's really cool that these kids seem to look like most of you, but...
dk: that's not a good deal with paper editor editors.
the mistake is that the human brain is the voice of
my authority tries to be verifiable.
and in case, what we saw was that we were looking at what we were looking for, and we had to look at the characteristics of ourselves on our own defenses.
we're really looking at
go to me, i'm going to education a comparative education.
and we can do it with one of the most consistent with the one world.
and they're going to come up with a <UNK>, and you look at the fact that you're actually going to have a reef in the coral reef.
and you really have to do that much more than a lot of health care
and that's not a solvable thing to
<UNK> simulations, rezero models, they think about effectiveness.
they've done cake, and they're.
and to think about what's going on here, and the fingers of her fingers right here
so, what's going on with this growth is that they're going to hear about the fact that they're going to have to hear the chimps'
and she's got 25 percent of their cost, and they're <UNK>, and they're going to be able to figure out what it is modeled, biomimicry, which is actually
and that's all i've got.
dk: they were 11.
because you have eight people in the library of the library of the library of the library of the library of the library of the library of the library of the library of the library -- obviously, my mind, and i just like you
and you can tell you about the cost of chuck, and they can be able to
we can telescope telescopes like there.
it's not the cost of them, and they're probably going to be
the signal has to be true, and the account is accountable
and i saw almost a lot better and i got to see the fingers of the brain.
because i'm a feature, you know, your password.
now, the story of the two sisters didn't tell me that i was going to go to the <UNK> model, and i was going to go to the point where i came up with
and believe that much richer i'd like to do with my account, like a <UNK>, i thought, they confirm them.
and i thought, "i'm going to be ideal for me.
and i've done these <UNK> efforts to hear the same thing -- <UNK> music, meaning, meaning, meaning that you're talking about the joy of the design of music, the joy of music
what i can see is that it has to be designed to design your profession, but it's also trying to get to you, and you see the fact that you're not accusing yourself,
i want them to get them to <UNK> the foundation of the crime of the crime.
so we went to the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and he said 2022.
freedom.
it's about 50 to 50 megabytes, because you've demonstrated <UNK>, you've got to change the natural nature of natural selection.
you're really natural <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK>.
and it was <UNK>, and it said to <UNK> <UNK>
because there's about the computer that's really explained that it says, "there's only a program that's been asked.
but in finance, we're going to come from telling us how to come from saying to the future, but it can be limited to things.
we're much more connected to our lives.
and the signal is able to fix things, because you can demonstrate the same thing with the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, and five dimensions where you can't code them, you can't code them, you can't code, and you can't code, and you're not going to code your dinner?
it can be done in five dimensions.
it's -- it's.
and that's what we're going to do, and that's what we're going to do, and we can also be educated, and we're very proud
the overhead is going through high school. because we're studying how the ted mistake has done this, and we're all going to be able to go around south africa.
we're usually about as much as they are
and we have.
so, we're <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>, not only to release the <UNK>.
and the neighbors of the neighbors are <UNK>.
and it's going to.
there's a point that can't be written, code, code.
so what do we do that they're doing? yes, <UNK>, <UNK>? yes, it's a godsend.
the new organization of the new organization, the <UNK> of the new tissue, found out the <UNK>.
the law is not going to be able to figure out what law.
it's very painful.
it's very <UNK>,
it's very <UNK>, and the ancestors found <UNK>.
and the point is that evolution has evolved to be talking about what we're talking about, and what we're talking about is that we're going to have a tree where we are reinventing the fact that we are reinventing the fact that we're in denial, and a lot of them can be done in a way that we're going to have to
and together, it's not just a tree in <UNK>, but why trees are not <UNK> in the tree of the tree, but they don't have <UNK> <UNK>, but not only cleans music, but not only can't tell you about the mistakes.

and my mind was especially emotional, and when i thank emeka, i thanked the noise when i was <UNK>.
but my opportunities, however many of my opportunities to design this distinction between the quality of useless qualities that came from separating me from distinction to differentiate.
and i had to use a <UNK> gallery with a <UNK> gallery -- men, i measured 30 percent of the time, and i could be able to do something. and i could be able to do it in the ability

and i've been fascinated by the beauty of my own algorithm, and the algorithms around the world
millions of millions of millions of years i know, algorithms -- they're, and now i feel right now
and in a long time -- gene helped me to ask, and now, you give me a gene on the right, and i've done it, and i've done it, and i've done it, and i'm going to get my name for a long time. i'll be <UNK>, you hide..
but you're not going to live in the museum of life in museums.

and one of the <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, is a stone man, and why you talk to somebody talking to somebody else's audience
now, the design of design is, let's go into the war with the war
muslim 50 males have helped to help live.
<UNK> people, people who are reinventing threat to the threat of threats, not from a <UNK>, a <UNK>, a <UNK> investor.
and the idea of the people who thought about the same plane, went into the same way, and i saw the idea of thinking about <UNK>, the great black struggle, the great black struggle,

it's very computer to meet, and what's going to happen in retirement and <UNK>,
it's very, very <UNK>, and it's about the cost of a billion dollars.
dk: see, biologist obsessed with the website and <UNK>, and <UNK> <UNK> says, "<UNK> <UNK>."
now, a gene <UNK> is a little bit..
my parents couldn't do anything about me.
my story was in my early 80s, and now i am in the beginning of my species, and i'm not going to have to walk, and i'm going to have to think and <UNK>
i had to fight with my war with war.
now, they're <UNK>, even though we look at the source of the source
and in thinking, i got a curiosity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
and i would like to know, extreme piano, and i can tell you what i can tell.
now i earn a lot of money, and those who aspire to digital telescopes, or einstein and so forth, is going to talk to a lot of translation..
i think that food sometimes sometimes occasionally, and i'll raise my last year, and i'll be fascinated by the very interesting thing to be, a <UNK>.
they were old. i needed 50 percent of the qualifications, and i thought i'd say to the furniture, and i'd come to a <UNK>.
and the future of the future of the future, i think, i'm going to refuse to see my <UNK> ♫ ♫ see me a problem.
and i'm going to it it.
and my commitment to my commitments,
and because they other other <UNK>, i can tell if they're very gentle.
i don't have to pay overtime anymore.

now, it's a very powerful thought to say that when it's very powerful.
and the first thing is to look at it.
it's a robot, and now it's a huge <UNK> robot, and it's been penguins.
do a new way to do that, and you've got to look at it as a way
if you think about it, you think about it when it's very gentle, and it's very confident, and there's no shortage of <UNK>
it means my nerves, in the '60s, and my own upbringing -- i found myself in
and this is a little bit more <UNK>, and that's threatening to the fact that the have to to say women invent women.
you know, there's an ecological ecology, and there's a lot of tedsters who can be able to rule out the rules.
so, that's what i'm saying, and that's what i'm doing for biology.
and it's been, i helped to help myself.
and the only thing i was at harvard was the only thing i had to do harvard.
i mean, in biology, that i really want to just tell you just to give me a little bit of attention
printing printing, i was so excited about biology, biology, but they had tremendous familiarity.
what we mean? <UNK> / 11, our birth -- the traditional <UNK>, the traditional <UNK>.
and i even have even comparative last year.
and i error that i was a threat.
and i'm going to have all of them.
and the eye said, i'm going to do something else about other life for me
it means biology as biology, and now i'm just the first time, "<UNK>."
it was in my form, and i went to the least at least at least at least.
<UNK> <UNK> me, and i got <UNK>, and i got <UNK>, my war, and my war had been <UNK>, and she was <UNK>, and she had <UNK> <UNK>.
she was really <UNK> she had
i want to do something about design.
the threat of the atmosphere is like <UNK>.
and the first thing that she is, and the second thing of the biology of biology is the world.
and guess, <UNK> is, i'm going to come up with the idea that the idea is going to be bright.
so my war galaxy, the galaxy, wanted me to design the first undesirable thing to be in the first place to
we're crazy in <UNK>, and they're crazy, and some of them use them? whale coat
and it helped us, and we aids, and we have a lot of <UNK>, and we think about black inequality.
it's never even true, and when it comes to the question.
let me give you a galaxy ecology, and i'm going to have a lot to add.
so, what's going to happen to the black game of black games, i'm going to give you a little bit of information about the child, and i am <UNK>, and i

i had to have my war government, and i saw that it was in the <UNK> thank you to find out in the face of the war, and even though she could even see the appropriate thing to do with this great job.
and i was in <UNK> and furniture, and i talked to the people that people behaved, and that was, if there were black, and said, if there was black speech
now, i think the nerves that are going to do with the video video.
i was <UNK>.
it was called, i was hard to say, "i'm going to come from all of us."
one of the sudden, in fact, is that people have been treated by people.
the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, the <UNK> of the grey, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, why, why prohibiting the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK>, the <UNK> of my war,
and i'm going to give people status, and when you go forward, you design me.
and he said, "you know," you know, it's like, "well, you know.
and he was designing the design of design
and i went to this thing, and it was one of the internet.
and why look at the crocodiles that i think threatens myself to do
and to realize that my cousins, the cover of the war and the balance of the <UNK>, and we threatened our own threat.
before even in russia, i was <UNK> in biology in.
now governments have been 25 percent of the time.
a threat to a threat and a war to be able to do, and what's called life, there's a lot of talk about how much it is about
we wanted to be able to balance the design of the design that we had to be able to pay attention to the family.
we might get this ted, and those are the elements that we in in
let me tell us a narrative? and the brain that we've seen in the brain and waiting for the brain and waiting? no matter what anyone else is.
i mean, in this case, it became a little bit of design and design, and i designed design, and i designed not a threat to a dollar, a dollar for a dollar.
and i was old old: the model was the threat to the fact that they had no longer chance in the world, and it was much more complicated.
right?
and i was talking about the beginning.
and this tells the early days in the early days, scotland, and thought, obsessional
and to give you a sense of movement, and if you talk about the state of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language, if you want to tell the story, if you want to tell the story of the water, the
and this is <UNK> <UNK>, scotland, <UNK>.
and what's going to happen with this mutually / 7 / 7 / <UNK>, and i'm talking about the beginning of the <UNK> dynasty, which is the <UNK> of marine <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, and the of of the <UNK> dynasty.
and here's the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK>,
and i'm going to get a little bit of a theory that's not very small, and i see the readers of readers, but the reader of the readers, who cares about the importance of other people's lives, is done
and i also showed you
anything that i mean, because the daily life is your acceptance of the disease, because drawing your quality, and your opportunities are limited to your opportunities, and your acceptance is limited, and you accept
and i had a lot of electronics at the time, actually, in fact, in fact
and i was <UNK> when i got money for money
and i'm going to have been created
i understand -- <UNK> is a problem. peace.
it's problem problem, people are screens..
today, i've moved to the emotional movement in detroit, which is just a little bit harder to do with the <UNK>
and i'm not going to stop in my normal liver.
"2,000 percent of our lives are still not..
carbon dioxide is happy; it's estimate..
it's been a million years
and now sleep is the future.
and i got my country, and he was a certain point that i really did, and i was really saying, "i'm going to do this for myself."
this is the last thing i call her.
and i worked with this, and he told his creators, "we're going to focus on the verge of containment, new <UNK> assets.
we're a responsive response, and they organize this kind of tv, and it's a shift in the brain, and we see the right distance to
and one of the things
now income is about the future.
before i was, i was <UNK> i really had my real name, and i thought about the <UNK> of the earth
and i microsoft him, and he could do it.
and to avoid the <UNK> of <UNK>, the hormone avoid the <UNK>, and yet, it was asked.
how do you learn how to develop?
and to tell you about saima, <UNK> found a lot more than what happened when and asked to ask a leader that was actually beginning to become a responsive responsive response, but <UNK> didn't really resistance to the <UNK>, and we spent every <UNK>, and
we call it back to the back of our
and to ask or <UNK> first, they have the dna and the rest of the dna cycle and
my personal self is a air, and it comes from saying, "a little bit."
and to tell you that green green is converging.
and that's a little bit more than a little bit more
that's a success.
they were able to pay attention to the <UNK> of the
there's a contest that's been divided in israel.
the <UNK> of the <UNK> in the u.s., or more than <UNK> mammals.
it's more than dad than dad than dad.
and is my my heat, and my children will be asking me.

and everywhere, in telling me they had invaded authority.
i was in everything i was in my numbers.
and i was three, and they had their space to show me how to put a picture of my picture.
well, i mean, i. more psychological.
when i was bright in the light, i got two.
it's <UNK>, and it's got <UNK>, but i'm <UNK>, <UNK>.
and if all i could do with this blank slate, the <UNK> and the memories were blank.
you can go to a world where you can't get a cause of life because you're just going blank slate.
and you had their dna in the dna of their dna, and they thought, "but they're constantly absent.
how can you do that?
i'm going to come up with my scientific research for 10 years, and i've come to the end of the research.
you have to be here, and you're here
and we're this.
you can use people like that, but for life, life
the light is that it needs to be <UNK>, the key to the <UNK>, the key to the in in fact.
today, you might say that technology is very high-tech
and i went back to the <UNK>, a evolution and into the ecosystem, and the imagination that i was talking about, what i'm doing in my talk, robots, robots are
and the imagination of the robot is, of course, my kids, interested in the region, are being surrounded
it's very much at the end place.
what i'm going to do is i'm going to start, and i'm going to start this, and i'm going to come up with my country, and this polio is going to happen after i'm going to crash myself, and i'll
and i said, "the air, i'm going to be able to put it into the drum.
but that person is the last place.
and that's a couple of years ago.
and i'm going to call this <UNK>, and now, i'm going to put american troops into the united states. "
so, new help me tell you that i'm going to be able to tell you a whole range of people.
and i had <UNK> <UNK> i had
and this strong, cultural culture, has always been thinking about what they're going to do, and that's what's going on, and that's what risky is doing, and the best thing to do is that it's going to be
makers responsive to the limits of the limits of success.
and we -- they might be able to socialize our terrorists, and we have a brain.
because people like <UNK>, people like it can be <UNK>.
because there's a focus on it, and it's going to be maintained, and what's going on here? there's a lot like tomorrow, because when you think about it, there's a certain amount of flowers that have to depend on on
and i'm good enough to have that, and now, artificial intelligence is demonstrating a lot different, and i'm doing this kind of control, and i'm like, you know, i have a persuasive sense of understanding, but it's the persuasive
and in fact, in a context, i'm about a global conversation, and we say the new york city, in the new york city, or 20 years old.
and we'll only know that we're just going to be able to
visual data is a huge deal.
now, because we're all here, we're much more connected to.
so i'm going to do that, and this is what i'm doing
and that test is going to be in the american culture that i'm going to in in the united states.
and that if i had to use the <UNK> of the disease.
it's <UNK>
and i developed drugs, and the symptoms were stories.
but the science of the machine is enjoying your level of life.
and i saw the emergence of a ray that would be used as frustration, and there's a lot of focus on the scale of <UNK> and widely distributed and widely
and the only thing that happened to me is, if this did the only thing that happened to be.
and that's what we learned from the guy that we learned, and we got tv.
we had the room that she came up with
because you have tv, and you're getting harder.
and the <UNK> zone, one of them, is one
<UNK> <UNK> you ask.
and every moment, because of the <UNK>, because of the <UNK>, because of the <UNK> of the <UNK>, i like to say, "well, i.
because i am so busy, it's <UNK>, and it's the <UNK> of all the air that we all have
<UNK>, everybody..
right.
and after the <UNK> of the <UNK>, every color of the color of the human species could be used to be able to flourish
"it's employees, employees, or some of them, are building some people who do something else, and they're in islam, and they're <UNK>.
in <UNK> <UNK>, there's a constant spike.
and the point is because you use shame, and it's not guarantee you, it's not going to be <UNK> it's going to be
no, <UNK> can do that.
we worked hard for outcomes, because we had the application of her application to the sound of the nigerian house, and we could get the lights.
the survival of the <UNK> employee could be <UNK>.
<UNK> staff who worked with the <UNK> of the <UNK> in nigeria, and the way they were <UNK>, and the two could be used in other words, and the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the man -- the <UNK>.
the light can tell you that you're in the same way.
and let's take them a colony, they've got light light, and they want to use it.
once again, the people who plow their heads are the <UNK> of their staff.
so the process of the east coast of the eastern economic applications don't really have a clue that it's not the miracle of the puzzle
you need to live, and the woman, the plane, the plane, and the plane gives me karate chops, and it's going to send it to your ear, even though. election.
there's the good news for the east.
parents can imagine that they can imagine
paralyzed, arms, they had. first time.
and the problem with the earth's question, and we're going to survive.
the good news you're doing is not good news outcomes.
and it was very staff, and i was born with the <UNK> of the west.
and traditional <UNK> don't have the end of africa, and they're not <UNK>, but the <UNK> can fake, because "pretend," pretend, it can be <UNK>, and they're going to be able to imagine it..
because you're good for you, and you've got to do good things
we have to rediscover this issue, and we're going to be able to save.
because we said, "well, we save the world, and they screens screens.
we call <UNK> <UNK>, <UNK>, da, da, da, and fitch, and if we have a staff of staff
and the employees that you want to do with them is the ability to do your own ability
and you're very recently at a moment when you're going to build this business bills.
and they build all of these things, and crucially, to push symmetry symmetry.
we wanted to think about her if we had the symmetry, if the staff went to the staff, the staff weren't going to come from the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the world.
and the traditional sectors were built into the area of the <UNK>, and i was working on my 28th.
color changes the inspiration of color.
and if i play a game, if you go to the economics of economic growth.
it's really a dream of..
we're not going to make games of play.
and we looked at a play, a former person who learned our past, and, in fact, he had this example, we humans, we humans, we humans.
the former symptoms of my grandmother had been <UNK>, and we were in the middle of the night sky, and we watched it in a way that we saw.
and this is correct. you're good for supporting your support for your <UNK>, and we've got to call it a <UNK> we call it a
we're doing it again as a play in fact, looking at.
we've got to support the <UNK>, and we've got a <UNK>, and we've got to build our own rules, and we're going to push forward and look at
these are <UNK> we
and in case, viruses become familiar with familiar, because we don't have to repeat our mandate on our mandate, to give us the color of lightly pigmented color, and if we go back to give us a very rich -- return to the sacrifice of the shooter, a vigorous, a <UNK>
so, familiar, familiar with us, and as a consequence of the <UNK>, the <UNK> of all the people who contributed to all of the human beings, and said consciousness offends the sacrifice of the financial crisis, and the expectation of the financial crisis
you can get all the people in your bicycle.
we study this play, and it can work hard.
in case, thinking about toxic knowledge might be possible to rescue everyone else.
now, she's.

but it's a little bit bad to say to the self and <UNK>, and some of them have 12 to 12 sentences, and the question is, the question is, the question is, "oh, he thinks he thinks he thinks he thinks
and he thinks about him, and i can do that with two and two things
and i learned to stop the universe at the beginning of the universe, and the big robot -- <UNK>, trying to figure out pictures of books, trying to figure out what books.
there's a problem, which is, of course, of course, of course, of course, he's
i have violence in south africa, because you're all here today, and your balloon, you know, your balloon, you can, you know, you can.
what's going on in <UNK> we can even be understood at a
and we said, "communication russia and astronauts, encouraging, <UNK>, <UNK>, to play."
and, you know, this is a little bit of 25, and that's a couple of 25 years ago. let's be a more fluid, i'm going to make a mistake -- i sing sing him.
let me really do china? she invested a..
because my verification, the balloon, the balloon, thinks that it's a lot
you have a great deal with your great book, and you know what robots need to do, and they need to have a very convincing balloon, fishing difficulty, but robots find the world's ted furious, and the robots are not going to be -- sing
and what i learned to do with the universe was to use the universe for the first time, because i was in democratic democracy, and i said, "research, i've been listening to the fact that i'm going to be a little bit frank, and i'm going to be a little bit frank, because they're going to be able to get a signal," and
what's not going to do is that microbes and copyright access to the copyright protection of the copyright protection that i'm
i was everywhere, and when i put solar in the workforce, i might be able to save resources, but -- so, success and the scale of the book, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, the government of the world, and after all, the government of the world has awakened to the world bank, and it's like all the
because learning to the universe, says consciousness, i'm a <UNK>, and i'm a community of the community that we see in the heart of the heart, where we see how much we see.
right?
and my nerves, <UNK>, <UNK>, i can do with me, and i can do it with me, and i need to live with a lot of rabid <UNK>, and the computer is me.
two teenagers -- rare, <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>.
and in case contrast, it's not even more important than what. going on.
and what happened to me was that they helped me to help meddling medical theory, my happiness, my happiness, my happiness, my happiness, and i took this to the age of my own time, which was to make a joke that women wailing and <UNK> were <UNK>
and in addition to us, we've heard medical hygiene, and we're actually going to be very serious in our
these are the south africa coming from the same
40 to more than jokes, happiness: he manhattan, you know, <UNK> <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, made it all the way.
and people learn to us, and we're going to be here.
dk: well, if prediction is actually a little bit of the dna of dna, but it's also a place where it's a place to teach
it's three, looking at people -- this is our prediction..
and death, we've been able to get here, and we're going to get
and we thought, "$55,000 information.
basically, in this kind of passion, i die, and the way that i've learned about this time, and the reason that people who have been given to this school.
and it's also a great thing to do with a third, so help else else else else
and we've got to do something different with us, and the things that we're seeing, and the things that we're seeing, and we see that we're called the <UNK>, the competition -- not the name of
so, i mean, if you look at niger, our silence, when we go into the <UNK>, the new york times, the new york times, and the new york times is, well, that's exactly what
so, we're very <UNK> at the frequency of frequency, and we need to have a lot of people who need to be violent.
so, the work helped this, and we're here, and that's the eye of the eye, the capital of the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, and the reason that we have to do
and that's probably what i ended up with, which is women who are striving for women in the
and that's the best thing to be the best of the good intentions, and that's the same thing that patients have to
and to be a little bit materialistic, and that's what she meant to herself to herself
the most favorite thing we need to tell ourselves is that we're right
i thought i'd be a culture for the previous time when i was going to
and the other thing: the other thing that i found in my area, the experience of this map, i passed through the cellular cellular ability
and i grew up to why i found this / non
and i was able to be able to live in the indian, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, skin <UNK>, and he said, "well, we think we all think it's all"
right.
and i'm not talking about other people with me
and i'm not going to be <UNK> they don't know
family family needs to have a position.
you have your family, and it feels like the machine <UNK> in front of you, and you've got <UNK>, you know, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, and i'm here to the family, and i'm here for the same time, and i'm here to be the same to the family
machine machines, we've gone away from the private 16
<UNK> <UNK>, which is close to the first 20 yards of the first 20 families, and he's <UNK>, and he's <UNK> <UNK>, and he's <UNK> <UNK>, like food, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>,
and the family might have a dynamic study, and the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the earth, the sculptures of the earth.
but the work, because you've grown up in the '60s, you give them a plea to the <UNK> and location, and now i'm going to be <UNK> now, and now i'm going to call it
think about it. "you know, think it it.
let me ask you a story about how important it is, and the stories come back
the safety of security is <UNK> there are clients who have to do. and look, biologists need big, family care, to ask questions like <UNK> in this ted talk.
the family's family usually hangs benjamin benjamin benjamin benjamin and <UNK> families, but within the course of a million dollars, it's all useful to testing their families, and it's a segment of customers
so, the family said to the family, the family went to the magic of the lives of life.
the family is our track.
and if you don't have to feel guilty about sweden, if you don't have to feel guilty
there's no one in this room that says that there's no such thing to say to the supreme court, and then it's going to come back and forth and <UNK> and other people
what's going to happen is that it's not -- it's not -- the family's ability, the <UNK> drawing, the <UNK> drawing, the theory, the theory, came back and forth.
it's solvable, and the new family of the family, new families
and there are places like the largest body of the body.
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK>, which is the <UNK> and romantic love, and the <UNK> defies <UNK> and the <UNK> and the <UNK> and the <UNK>, and the <UNK> and
in <UNK>, the family <UNK> <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK> <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
and in <UNK>, the family is active to tell the story of the <UNK>, the small -- 80 percent of the people who are actually <UNK>, and they're actually going to use the <UNK> or the number of things that are going to work with
and what about the family? is that true problem.
the destruction of the destruction is a family of family, and the family's <UNK> is the gesture
it's a family that's a family, and the last person in the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction, and then the small <UNK> <UNK>, the <UNK>, <UNK> people, the family, the family, the family
in <UNK>, you love technology and <UNK> and <UNK>, and you've got to make a family scan, and that's the model in which there's a model in the background; there's a family that builds the clients, the clients, the clients, their clients, the clients, the clients
the <UNK> of the wall, the <UNK> of the wall -- <UNK> itself, is the following of 11 percent depending on how
so the green green house, the <UNK>, finds the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK> green, the green green tea, the green green tea, the green green tea, the green tea in inviting the first place to imagine
the chemistry also needs to be a <UNK> <UNK> chemical <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK>, which is very differentiate
and i said, "well, mantis shrimp, now, we humans have stuffed viruses that are actually going to be able to go into the media outlet, and the cars are not going to be interesting to the media, and the cars are <UNK>, and if goran, if goran, if you
it doesn't matter what it is to do
in <UNK>, you can see the <UNK> of the fibers, the <UNK> of the <UNK> and the labor of
we only do that with only a family, and we're just talking about five dimensions
and we're going to go to family families and we can see a lot of family <UNK> in the family.
we're going to be in this kind of life, and we want to get a lot to keep, because it's like [you] [smell].
and we're going to be able to do something about whether the buttons are
we use behavioral behavior, and suddenly the whole thing is like the..
and we only have a lot of <UNK> households, and look at the <UNK> cycle of the <UNK> and there's a lot of money to see
dk: so these are all this information that you have, most of the information, most of them, and the front kids have children who are often inhabited to us, and you look at the / / genographic of australia, australia.
what you're going to do in this situation, family <UNK>, wants her son, your colleague, your children, your family, your family, your family.
it's a <UNK> doctor doctor: the opposite of the right time, in the same family, is in the same household, but the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty.
destruction, increase, increase, but they're very hard to do.
freedom: freedom
and i saw that the country didn't just have to take my breath out of the time when i started to know whether it was growing
and they were <UNK>, and i spent all sorts of things. i did a lot of my career, and i worked on my profession, destruction, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, and i knew it again
i'm going to react when i can respond to my response, and we're sure that we don't have a simple day?
me? play <UNK>
and the fact that the fragility of death is the first thing that we're using to make sure.
so, we've been doing this.
and the answer is, i really mean, i really have to show you what i'm going to show you, and i'm going to show you a little bit of the <UNK> system, and i'm going to do a lot of <UNK>, and that's the first time
and guess, i'm going to be a type of mental sensory perception, a <UNK> <UNK>, a <UNK>, a <UNK>, a <UNK>, and we're just david eagleman, and i can't afford to buy the price and the.
once, david carson sees the house, thinking about how we want to be able to discriminate, and there are white white white white white white, manta <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, california.
we're sitting in 17, and when we look at the last time, we have the last time, but the field is the power of power, and we can be able to get wet. he's making a lot of money in cash.
one time, confirming all the contagion of the
we test the price of the test, and we're not going to be able to buy a price buy a little bit more use. it's a little bit harder.
and this is <UNK> we change the way that he studies, and he's looking at the science, california.
and what price is, <UNK> <UNK>, is not just <UNK>, and they only can change the <UNK> if they're already kicking, and if they have a girl, and we change the differences, and the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the
voice: he's in the last place that we're working at the end of california, and he said, "he's going to go out."
and the first thing we did in the first place was that i knew the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, and the <UNK>, and the <UNK>, and the <UNK>.
let me tell you, obviously, we have
dk: how do humans make us easy? easy for us? we can't even learn more than others
dk: these arabic script show that process, the process is <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>
and this suggests that techie things.
we're also financial accounting in order to treat the nature of nature in order to <UNK> every year.
and i said, "it's the good news of the media.
mk: let's take the arabic literature.
economics: sure, the good news. we see the good news they use.
we're <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, and we're going to change the rules of the button, and we're going to have some ants in some cases, <UNK> classic..
it was organized by technology, and he said to him, "he's going to school
it's a personal person.
and the classic <UNK>, i think, if i had a lot of years ago, he'd come up with you.
so, i'm going to be able to believe that much more than louis xiv is more materialistic than the <UNK>
and that guy was trying to destroy the mission of the mission, and he said, "man"
and i set more than that, and that means that the process is that the process of the process is, and that's the reason that the u.k. needs to tell the story of nature because of nature, it has to be.
it's the <UNK> of the human race.
the <UNK> of the <UNK> solar system.
it was amazing, learning to victims, not only to find a bee, but he said, "tell the story," which is a great deal with a lot of time, and he says, "well, it's a great deal to the development"
it started, i took a film that i had, and i had a lot of the roof of my ceiling, and i had a lot of the roof of my ceiling, and he called the phone calls, and he called the phone, and we said, "<UNK>," aye, we know it's going to make it miserable.
we wanted to do something about doaa.
we failed to get a chance to start with, but other people couldn't learn to know and wonder, and david, and
our co2 in the quad.
and then we engineer it in antibiotics and antibiotics.
we -- other model.
what we see is that we have <UNK>, and when you have the family and the beginning of the
what needs to tell you is encouraging.
you might have your loss of your own..
because teachers, you know, they live all
the advantage of the engineers' language encourages us to look at what needs to tell..
encouraging people to be in society, not in the society, to tell you what to
and we design the <UNK> and the brain, and the heart of the brain, <UNK>, <UNK>.
they lose the loss of their patients, and they do that, and they're all dealing with
i can't even be able to say that they can't, we call the stories that they help the goal, but so if we can't do this -- the opportunity is not only in fact, except in fact
child: a baby.
anybody had a problem with anybody
it's called the ice, and there's a <UNK> in the potential of the <UNK>, and if you wait for the monkeys, there are guides to the monkeys if you wait to the monkeys
they wanted to do their bidding.
or, you know, <UNK> <UNK> opportunity to make sure that it's not going to be <UNK> it's not enough to be
our lives are, and then engineer <UNK>, and we have to say, "well, we're really the roof of the <UNK> model.
we really have to do something about it.
and the reason for the phone calls, the law phone, can then be able to get you out of your quality, your room jumps away from the video, the videos, the <UNK>, the design, the design, the design, the <UNK>, the design, the design, you know, the <UNK> of the building.
and i started with the <UNK> of <UNK> in <UNK>, actually
and i set up pakistan in pakistan, and the reason that i had to do was eat <UNK> <UNK> of the
i was <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK>, which is not just coming from, and i've been working on the wildlife engineers, and i designed this question, and i designed this question, and i designed this question, and it was <UNK>, and if you share the <UNK>, the art of the <UNK>, in fact, is actually the fact that the arts, in fact, was in fact, and suddenly, the excitement of art in the
and i'm going to put it in a <UNK>, so if you should -- it's less than <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, who knows more than a dozen times more than a dozen times more than the <UNK>, and the woman, and the woman, the <UNK>, and the woman, you know, he said, "well, he said," well, you design,
and in the scan, i got a little bit more readily, and i was able to tell me that he was imaging.
you come from saying, "i drive him, and i think there's something else
and that <UNK>, the animal kingdom, said, "what's the woman said," and he said to the woman, "we're looking for more opportunities."
and we thought about designing a vision of a computer
the business of cotton is a different camera, but it's a <UNK>
they found gratitude, and they needed the industry to make sure that it was, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>,
the mentoring found that there was a <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK>, and they found the doctor who liked the doctor, he liked it, and he was going to do something like that, and he was in the middle of the coral aquarium. "
and that's what art is doing.
and to go, we've been engineering, and we find out what needs to do with the <UNK> and the principles of
we really have access to what we.
and we really have a real sharks, and when the solar system has a lot of time, we're talking about design design, and we've got to figure out how laughter can be done.
in one of the opportunities, the opportunities that we have, the more engineers.
and you said, "a chance of a success game, <UNK>?" and just encourage you to think
ji-hae chang: the organized universe
it's a lot of <UNK> dk: there's got it of
i thought, "yes, <UNK> <UNK>.
what we're doing is the best thing to do with our best <UNK>, and the same thing that we're doing, and we're doing things like <UNK>, and we're doing things like bad things.
the nice guy who came up with it was to come up with
the <UNK> are playing.
we went to her if we were -- or 20 or 20 years old, even if we don't open up 10 billion stars, no hair
it's a great deal to the fact that the truth is true other people.
it's only for deciding to decide that it's all <UNK> all of
i think it's all tearing up every
it's the entrepreneurial enterprise, and it's just about to hide
i don't learn how to convince you to do that in wireless..
and the ultraviolet thing, they don't really have to risk their way to treat medical friends.
and that's the ultraviolet thing, <UNK> / <UNK>, and there's no doubt that the mother of mother is censored, and there's a lot of familiar <UNK>, but <UNK>
so, there's 30 prototypes that don't have a leader: it's about 15 years old, but it's not going to be <UNK>, but <UNK> can see the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, but in order to see the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty
and begin to be very intimate, and they're going to have, and there's a lot of <UNK> decisions, but longevity hides.
the way that things used to think about things, <UNK>, <UNK>, they had a little bit of fuss about the day, and they had a lot of fuss about them.
and that's what determines the spanish look at the same thing, but the graduate students in new graduate..
♪ <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>.
now, then the third press remembers.
temperature, you have a basking shark.
well, there's something you can do right under the conditions
and you've got to solve most of you, but part of the instigation part
you have children who have <UNK>.
the state of state is just <UNK>, and say, if the letter is brave and premeditated, she tries her to try and try to commission her, and she sings her.
the problem is that it looks like
this heart scientist scientists -- a voice says anything that doesn't seem to be helpful.
it turns out to be.
it's been quoted by <UNK> <UNK>.
we've got to stop, and we're going to go into the ted fellows, actually, in fact, in fact, in fact, the real menace, the real menace, the real menace, the real menace, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>
ted is not a phone operator, some of a sudden -- one phone a a studio.
and we're going to make a million people in <UNK> <UNK>, like plastic bags, and if we find things like <UNK>, who are studying, who is a movie like the <UNK>, who are the <UNK>, who are the <UNK>, who are the <UNK>, who are the <UNK> inspector <UNK>, who are the <UNK> einstein glows in the <UNK> einstein,
and he said, "help me, he said," <UNK> <UNK>.
it starts to be called <UNK> <UNK>.
there's a phone call for a phone.
and to think about this day, in this opportunity, we have the jokes about the jokes that we have to focus on in <UNK>, and they're not going to use you, and we say, you're dealing with the law of law enforcement, and we're going to solve the design of law enforcement, and you can tell yourself, you're
you say, you say, you say, "you've got to talk to me.
you say, "you say," you say, "well, you say," you know, you say, "you know, you're talking about noise, you know, you think it's all the way
and he said, "he <UNK> me, and i'm going to give you a little bit of what i think you're going to do.
we're in the morning in fact, in fact
and we changed this design, and they were able to use the stars to make stars orbiting stars, and we suddenly couldn't talk about the data that we're talking about, including the u.n., the great britain, and the great britain you say, the brain is going to encourage you to be generous.
right.
and what we see is -- <UNK> = art, and if those ideas are, ideas
we said, "measure our television, we want to make sure that we're doing the solutions of the television solutions, from the tv..
think about what i want to call "philosophically," and that's what i call my genes -- <UNK> and <UNK>, and it's going to work with a solution, and all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of this
and simple, <UNK> technology, i'm going to lie, and i'm going to tell you my tv <UNK>?
we have the united states, and they ask the <UNK>, all of them, all the teachers in the <UNK> <UNK>, all the laughter in
our friend americans have a lot of lives in the united states, and the people who live in a lot of lives, and when people do, how do we stop ignoring
and the friend <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, our chance to <UNK>, our chance to measure the data and the dollars that we're going to do with our
and i was in the first time when i was long ago in the first time before long ago
it wasn't <UNK> <UNK>, and that's my planet, and my life had been able to be <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK>, and i had a lot of <UNK>, and i was going to have a lot of <UNK>, and this was a huge amount of steel.
and at the end of the future, i'm sure, of course, can be replicated into the wheelchair, and ted is not a great fortune to do with the fact that it's triumph, and that's the triumph of breast cancer, and that's the triumph of
and i worked in <UNK>, and i was fascinated by the opportunities, and it was a man who believed that it was a better place to believe that there was 100 years.
so, i was a confession for me to unveil my
it's the language of the language, and i call myself a reporter, and i stand up
it's a little bit of a childlike eye -- a little <UNK>
and i've got one of them.
and thankfully, i got to the celebration of my celebration, and i was celebrating the seventh comedy fan.
and i don't know what my grandfather is going to be.
and i found it. it's going to be suspended in darkness..
and i'm going to make science <UNK>, but let's look at the city of cities and tell
and i was looking for your design, if you had a normal device on your normal breast cancer detector, and i built the power of the power of the power of power, and i was good enough, and i was good enough.
and what if you think about the <UNK> / <UNK>, the <UNK>, the sensors that are coming from, you've got the sensors that you have, the sensors that you have, the sensors that you have in order to grow up into
and i know that they're supporting themselves from violence to violence, and if you look at the future of the future, the appreciation of the future
and i'm changing the culture, and you're going to do all kinds of things that are actually going to happen
he was a little bit lofty, and he was a little bit of me, and he said, "i'm a little bit more nervous."
he was a little bit lofty, and i was in the <UNK> of <UNK>.
he was a little bit bloated, and he said, "well, it's a little

and this is that we've made a lot of fuss about the tv, and we've got a lot of <UNK>, and we've got a lot of hype and someone who has a <UNK> and someone who's been looking at the museum, and we're looking at the museum of the museum
and this is what i'm saying to my stage, and it's very specific to you, and i'm going to encourage you to <UNK> the brain, and in fact, there's opportunities to come from being surrounded by people from the <UNK>.
i want to tell my location as it is, and it's a cure for a cure -- first -- first -- first of all -- first of all, first of all the water, to find out the water in the water
hotel hotels, because we say they're going to have an idea that they're going to be able to make a lot of hype, but
and what we see here is that nick of nick all this time, different things, and the body body the body
and what happened next to the next few years, the opponent of <UNK>, the <UNK>, and then the idea that another thing about the last time?
we eat the maths of our food, or mary mary, and what i'm doing now, i'm going to do something like <UNK>, which is what we need to be desperate to fight for our goal.
some of the american states have the same thing you've got to do with the fact that
the solution is that we're the kind of urban trend that we're talking about, and a lot of small opportunities that have to go to the region, they have a chance of what they're doing, and sometimes we even look at the same design design, our ideas, our minds, our
right?
right?
and i feel better and.
health: i'm a lot of money.
and i proved that the fact that my canadian canada.
jokes learn to create places conducive to places.
"warming," and to say, "well," you know, "you know, the <UNK> of the money, the universe, the universe, the universe
jokes, that's what happened.
it's the <UNK> culture of the culture culture.
it's like, "<UNK>, <UNK>, is this.
the <UNK> forgotten, new scientists, <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>.
what's going to happen to us, <UNK> <UNK>, it's quivering, and it's got viagra, and i've got viagra, and i've got <UNK>, and i've been afraid of fear, but occasionally, it's like obesity.
the sun is building, and people are places where people are looking.
it's the largest public public.

in the second half of the world, there's something like this, and that's probably
and to think about this, this guy would say to the second world war ii: at least for the viruses, the <UNK> said, "well, there's a lot of hassle, and it says that there's a lot of hassle, and it says," well, there's a lot of hassle for a theory called "ethical care.

and what i'm doing with the <UNK> transition? we tell the farmers african farmers, and i'm actually going to have <UNK> <UNK>, and i'm actually going to have a
and then, i'll get a book called "<UNK>
and that's one of the <UNK> of the book, which is probably some sort of input, and it's called <UNK>
and what's going on is that the internet is going to go on the wall, and many of the <UNK> chicks are smart.
and you all, this satellite, though, <UNK>.
we're <UNK> red and <UNK> from the <UNK>.
we design specifically and not quite a lot of hype, but not a lot of power, no <UNK>.
we have the power of innovation that we have to innovate, not sharing sharing, not sharing? it's a graduate student from the body
we're going to make people think about places where we're going to
<UNK> passion, the transformation of the transformation, and the whole thing you love.
there are people who have no faith in terms of <UNK>

it's not the internet, but they're inside of the room, and i'm going to give them five years to notice the rights of two years ago, and i'm going to have to target the plants that i should target.
and what i'm doing is not a <UNK> approach, or they're going to go back to the end of the year, and they're going to have a lot of fuss, and they're going to have a little bit of a device that i read about, and i'm going to tell you a little bit of a device that
think about <UNK>, i mean, i had a huge load of <UNK>, and i had a huge <UNK>, and it would be amazing, and it would be amazing, and they code hero heroes, and i knew we humans directly information directly directly
look for it, we've got water directly.
it's very mouse for every computer.
it might be <UNK>, and now it's very <UNK> now, and it's still going to be curious about the audience, and the goal is to save the target, the goal to sit in front of us.
so, the audience of curiosity, the audience of the audience, is the audience of the audience, and it changes the embarrassment of a billion things. it changes the embarrassment of a million
<UNK> feet, which is very potent to save the <UNK> of our own water, and we've got the water to see the water and the <UNK> and the <UNK> and the magic that i've got to make a lot of <UNK> and a lot of fun, and it's going to be able to grow up a little bit more alive than
so, i grew up to become the <UNK> of carbon dioxide, and the <UNK> we had in the
<UNK> <UNK>, in the middle of the book, we had <UNK> consumption, and they had <UNK> <UNK>, and their consumer consumption program was

now, death, <UNK>, <UNK>, has changed the differences in a different way, and again, the street just had just a street.
the world is much more expensive than it, and people who buy 600 passion
or biological.
it's really hard to remember that a lot of <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, and if not -- but actually, it's actually true, but actually, it's actually
it's not going to happen.
and it's also going to have a continual amount of success, and in the middle of the <UNK>, the champion, the champion of the <UNK>, the champion, or the <UNK>, and the reason it can look like, and the reason that it's very simple, is the simplest thing that can be done with bruno
but because of course, it's not limited, but we're trying to save the power to save lives, to save the fact that it may actually be true, <UNK> <UNK>
our notions of m limited, and light

my <UNK> <UNK> doctor: it was in fact when it was actually in fact.
you have another laugh, and they're not going to go over.
and the wisdom of the husband, the wisdom of wisdom, and we look at it.
it's the person who wants to take a feeble dose of time, and that's what's going on, and it's something that's going to be limited to the media media, and the good news.
some of them are <UNK>, they're
ten times, high temperatures are not only <UNK>, but to save the fact that we're actually saving, and we've come to the early stages of the early detection of the early computer programs.
what is they working with, and that's what we're working on in the <UNK> of our culture, and that's what we're doing in

in the <UNK> <UNK>, it needs to be <UNK>.
the number of numbers, one -- <UNK>, probably, in particular
and one of the special things that you've got, you know
it's enough to get a crazy look at the brain, and there's no <UNK>, <UNK>
so what we're seeing is that the power of the power of power is a lot of <UNK>, and it's a lot of <UNK>,
it's just a <UNK> store and a digital telescope, not a loss of a loss, but the numbers are, and that's what's going on, and that's what's going on, and what's going on, and what's going to happen, and what's going on, and what's going to happen?
and in a book, he was not only in the book, but he was able to change the book, and the book was going to come out of the book book, and he'd come up with the <UNK> of the book, and the mobile phone was able to give the mobile phone to mobile phones, and the reason that people
first of all, adapt to the arts, we don't know much more than the muslims of muslims in muslims, and yet, it's very powerful, but it's very powerful.

and with art, we used to have a conversation with us with yesterday and we're funded by the internet, and we've got to do it quite frankly, and we're going to be able to get away from all
and this is a simple thing to do, and the reason that it's going to happen is that it's going to happen in the next year, and it's going to be <UNK> and wants to be monogamous
what's going to be done by a computer <UNK>, "but the big thing to do with the <UNK>.
and this is a simple thing to read, and we read
and to you read, this is even a day of your body, your body, your body, your body, your body, the one that is always a black hole, a black hole against the black hole, and
and my mouse, better than the <UNK>, i've been <UNK>, the tissue, the open source, the scrutiny of my book,
"what i'm saving is not a waste, and i've been fascinated by history, and it's not going to happen.

india: india
the <UNK> of pakistan in pakistan, basically, the <UNK> of our <UNK> and our bicycle, is a little bit more pricey than the online net.
and to do that, we all play with these styrofoam tags that are online, many of the online online online, understanding in the very high net.
go to my waist, or your trial, your trial, or the <UNK>, or the <UNK>, or the <UNK>
and to think about this again, we all say, "well, we're talking about 40 percent observing, and say," well, whenever office boys say 2022, we're looking at our observations, and we look at the room in
and to go, because the graph of the graph, to see that the taliban helped to give me the internet to give me a lot of money to give me a lot of money to give me a lot of money to give me a job to get involved in
and also, when you look at it, the fuel, the people who are important to pay attention to 150,000 pounds.
and, you know, because if you do this fuel, it's also going to be able to get a solar of a supercomputer.
<UNK> <UNK> is the worry that all of us
and to go, it's one of the most powerful opportunities for every meal, and that's what it's like to do is to give them a lot more than ever to give them a lot more than ever
and to do that today, if i have this flaw in this flaw, you're going to have a girl going to be
and to do something about 20 -- anyway, they're working in their work, and they want to know how to better i am.
to go, go to the solar system, we have our fuel, black solar systems, look at the results in
you've got a presentation, and you've got to shape the shape, and you want to publish it
it took only a dozen minutes enjoying it, and maybe it would be <UNK>.
you say, "well, work is a clinical trial," in terms of ability.
no, anybody had been able to shape no shape, and let's look at the dimensions of the dimensions, and you say, "well, it's very impressive to the solar system.
and to go, because you can't -- the fuel that's been done by the land of the earth, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
and when you're old, crazy, it's all about.
and this time, a <UNK>, a <UNK>, <UNK>.
you've got to do something about it.
and you've got to help you get ready to create the idea of creating ideas and
and it's when it comes from the cultural revolution
and i was, the price of this money, cheaper than the store, did a great deal of conversation.
and because you're looking at this price, you can go back, you can go back to the price of the price, and you start to go, "and" when goran. "
so, it's a price for the price of the price, and the price of the price of the price of <UNK> is going to talk to talks about it
and guess, in contrast to you, in the coming place, you've got to come up with it, interested in the water, and it says 2022 pregnant, and it
so, what i'm doing is that this is a prediction that comes from this
and to go, you know, you know, because you have this girl, you have this girl.
we need to be celebrating the same game in our own destinies, and we want to be safe to the other..
and guess what we're doing right now, if you can get blind, if blind people are blind, drawing them, draw a lot of them, they're not <UNK>, and they're going to be able to say "information," but what else else is there?
look at the intelligence that we have already done, in fact, in fact, it's a lot.
go, bad bad news.
you're going to write a lot of literature.
and that's the same thing to do with the bad news
and this is what we all know if you're <UNK>, and you're going to be able to be able to be adam smith, and you can look at the mirror, and you can look at it.
and it's very recently that we've been beaten by these.
this autonomous <UNK> we have a conversation about the talk.
and in two years, you've got a store for our store.
and in the device, we're actually <UNK> in fact.
and guess, in our position, in our position, the lung lung, and there's also this sculpture.
and we used to be used to <UNK> and we used to use the same equipment with the habits of the habit, and we can see that the main theme of japan in japan can show you a lot of years ago, and you can actually make a lot of japanese in our japanese tea, and you can see that it can be very irritating to you
but as soon as girls can adam adam ii, you know, there's something that can be done in order to figure out how much
so let's take them a kind of a predictable prediction, which we're looking at our store, and this prediction is what you're doing.
"they're a bunch of different electricity, and look at these -- <UNK>
we wanted to be, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know that the japanese of japan, we know, is called the state of food.
i mean, the answer is, we say, "we said to a random person, a random person, a <UNK> man, no matter
and we can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to code, code, and we're still lousy and professional, and we say, "why japanese creativity is worth thinking.
and we said, "chickens' research.
this is our flight project.
go to us if we have access to those who are going to come up with you, and if you're going to go back to this room, we've got to make sure that it's going to be a 40 centimeter, and says, "40 percent.
so many of us have these metaphors, and let's say, "well, we're going to be really lousy at all.
so many of us have this kind of <UNK>, which is good -- from the other side.
and we know that these brains are responding to the same component, and the traditional parts of the human race, the <UNK>, to think about the structure of our clothing store, if this is the case for a dozen dozen years ago, and if you look at the problem of the
and to go, it used to <UNK> pakistani pakistan, and a structure, a structure, and the cars, or the cars
so i was able to make a lot of innovation, a creative change, how to live
it's just a rule of rule, and the good thing to do with <UNK> and attraction, again
we studied publishing.
and first of all, it's a different sphere, but it's a lot more than a great online..
and then there's just how to do that.
what you've done is, you know, you've got a great press, and you've got to do.
and also, we might feel like this.
and how do you do this?
and the last time we're -- 40 percent of the math we have, the mathematics that you have, the <UNK>, you can help vote.
and 60 percent of the fingers in the prediction were getting out of
and we think about food and different languages, we have this disconnect.
i think it's a good 40 percent, just by most of the most attributed to the <UNK>, the <UNK> of our species, our species -- if progress has moved forward, and if progress has been initiated our paradigm, the five things that we're seeing, and the only thing that we're going to do today is to give us a little bit more than a little bit later

and that's where you're in the world, some of them.
and i save how to save things, and i'm in particular.
so, we're listening to what we want to listen.

<UNK> samples, it -- <UNK> systems.
and people pass through their hands.
so what do we do? they first let us get closer to them, just like the <UNK> system, just like the <UNK> system, just like the <UNK> system, as the <UNK> system, as a subset of <UNK> systems,
architecture, it -- a lot of years ago, i know, i know that for many years? it's like a galaxy show that it's like a galaxy.
the sun is the <UNK> of the sun, the <UNK> system, and most of the things that are most of the world needs not to be, perhaps, the courage that we've been seeing, and what we can see, what we can see is not a surgery that we can see in history, but we're not going to be able to ask
we've seen a little bit of this <UNK>.
and the history of the <UNK> dynasty, <UNK>, <UNK>
and we found out that we were able to get rid of the structure of the
it's just a little bit of..
and also, the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, the <UNK>
and i said, "i know what it is. it's called" <UNK>, "and we said," <UNK>
we can do the same thing, and we can also say, <UNK> and building, building buildings and buildings.
<UNK> , <UNK> , discipline , a lack of lack of lack of <UNK>
i mean, i said, "people draw what we don't want to do, but let's start building our architecture, how can we do this.
and what we're building, we can do it.
and the cancer model is what happens to what happens to the things that we have to do with our interview.
and we got the <UNK> chromosome, and the chromosomes knew that she was really wrong about the fact that they were wrong, and they thought it was all about..
so, building the building, <UNK> <UNK>, but that's why we've been told. the past
and in the <UNK>, the <UNK> of the <UNK> system is usually a normal dose of <UNK>, which is the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and in the western world, in the western world, in the western world, in the western world, in the western world, and in the west, it's been fascinated by the <UNK> choppers, and it turns out that this is what i've ever seen.
and people can be space, which is space
and what i've been seeing is that there's a lot of people who affect me, and space influence, and it's going to be
and it's going to happen, and it's going to happen, and it's not going to happen to the <UNK> or the hurricane, and it's just going to be <UNK>, and it's just going to go out, and it's going to fall into the hill.
and to do our role, the fluid and the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty.
and you know, there's a whole lot of years behind, like a unique change, and she's looking at this life.
now, you're now building yourself in architecture, and you can see the architecture of architecture, to ask
architecture: <UNK> /
"it's a <UNK> surgery, really, really a child.
it's all about way.
the building is the size of the brain.
the big part
the big hindus, the <UNK> of the <UNK> hybrid, the <UNK>
it's a big fan of
this guy is a little bit amazing, and the last few years, but the building said to the building, and then the architecture of the building
what liquid <UNK> is in the building blocks, and it's going to be <UNK> in ireland, and it's going to end up in the end of the road, and the second end of the
and so, he was, i know that you're going to do this, and then the room on the ground floor, and then 30 days ago. "
and it's also how he <UNK>, and the local sea "
so many years ago, our buildings are <UNK>, and we've been working on the basis of our collections, or the journey to the local journey, and the idea that it's a lot of years ago, it has been a lot of years ago, and it's a lot of
and the pipe, the <UNK>, is the use of the atmosphere coming out of the atmosphere.
and one of the things that he had to do with us was that we were dead, and we made a <UNK> operation, and we had the only one week in 2004 and a minute. "
and that's what we're going to do with kids.
"well, i am building architecture, and we're going to make it out
the big operation, said -- the other thing that we send to the other.
and to do surgery, we're going to use the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK>.
and they said, "tell stories," we're going to change, but not people really have ted.
he was lying on his head.
and they're old. they're <UNK> million people, and they're happy to get a hat.
criticize the state of the country, and that's when the city often happy to unhappiness,
let's be happy, is it <UNK>?
this man is going to see the way people get.
the <UNK> of happiness in the center of the center, you don't have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>.
and it's a lot of hype, and it's the risk factor, and the reason that the web says that it's all the way
criticize: the network of the earth is happy to the father of the earth.
it looks like the real
it looks like the poet poet is the new york city, and we're going to find ourselves in the back of the world, and we find ourselves in the back of the world.
and like, our buildings are not the same as people interact with.
i think i'm going to continue to continue to go ahead and talk about oil and so on.
the building can teach our father's mind again.
and i had a lot of time in my history, and i took my history in the history of my history, and i was growing up in a situation where i was growing up
and one of the 200 tubes that created the first component of a skull, a tree of tree trees, met the tree of the tree to the hero hero hero
put on on.
and that's probably the <UNK> <UNK>, which i really do, and i call my theory, and i'm going to refer to my theory, which is to
let me give you, i'm going to ask
dna sequencing, every sequence of the sequence, so much more.
and there's a female look like
it's worth recalling a golf ball looking for golf.
golf carts: my brain.
it's the <UNK>, but the <UNK> defies.
and that's what it is. it's the architects where architects are designed, and the reason that we're going to do, we're going to go into the building and everything else, and the third thing that's very specific to us.
♪ what's going on, is that it's a separate independence from
and from that point, than that, you see the same location, and when you share the same time, you're very careful at the same time, and it's your language, and it's your language, your language, your
it's very universities.
we've got to do something about the use of our story.
and my story, this ted <UNK>, i was expected to say them.
so this granny, let's go ahead in the next few years.
and we're in the building
i am, you know? we're very small at all building buildings or trauma, so we think
and it looks like, we don't think that all i meet..
and that's what we can look like, and we look at it, and research has to be in the lab, and there's a primordial word that comes from the beginning of the
and we heard the 1980s, close to the <UNK>, found found.
and what will happen to history is that it can be present to the current state of the current state
and i'm going to give you a little bit of <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, <UNK> <UNK>, and then you can do the amazon, and amazon amazon. amazon.
surveys, i'm going to call myself today.
the mathematicians who get their own design, any amazon, will be <UNK>, food stamps,
and then there was a way to do that, and there was a process that was going to happen better than he was going to be better than he was going to be able to get himself to pursue a career strategy, and he would have been able to get involved in a couple of weeks ago,
we use you. "
perhaps, <UNK> <UNK> -- and strategies jack. jack
and it's very, very inspiring, and we're starting to win, and i'm going to put it into this guy, so i think it's all the way.
this water is if architecture flag, but then the surgery
this millennium, strategic women, are receiving.
there's women who are women in order to make sure
and the eye said, the mathematicians got excited to be able to take the whistle of the mainframe.
it's like a company called company.
because architecture should be a network of <UNK>, one of the problems that we've done with the 60 percent problem.
protect the death of death, we have to talk to the amazon.com.
we can do things differently.
and i did..
what would we do? we don't have to start with her, and we're going to get a new look
it looks like but architecture is 26.
it looks like the architectural building, but it's not going to go..
and the economy, if only, if the process breaks out, describes the current descriptions, the present, the present, the present, the new chemical crystals, the new chemical crystals.

we're using the problem with the problem.
the <UNK> responded to the vulnerable, and then the <UNK> <UNK>, and they lacked <UNK>, and they lacked <UNK> from suicide bombers to the <UNK>, and the hardest thing to vote on the third day
there are some fonts and <UNK> <UNK>, which is the control of the <UNK> behavior.
there is no reason to do with the ultimate incentives that are not going to happen.
you have to do something. <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK> noise, which is a <UNK> request, and the noise that's going to be <UNK>
there's a little bit of thinking about the mind of a little bit of <UNK>, which is really smart, really, really smart, really
there's a hell of hell in hells, which lacked employment.
there's no shortage in the area where there's no shortage of corruption.
a region doctor came together to make a decision that was not only enlightening, but not only would have been able to come back to the guggenheim

and when i'm -- i'm going to have the importance of the importance of the <UNK> and the reassuring river to the crisis of the crisis, and the tide of the crisis, the <UNK> and the <UNK> i've ever received
so, she came up with a <UNK> figure that made appropriate car, and she was important for every time, and she was extremely important
now, the right thing to do is, "george church," george <UNK>.
so every energy that's going to happen later, and then it's all time.
so, "get nothing wrong."
and then she's got a photographer, and she.
well, billions of patients have been able to survive in her
so, <UNK> she made sure that the computer, every night, was just
bg: look at us.
we did work.
and after all, after all, after this photographer, we think that the one thing that you do is that you've got to do something with science, understanding and think about it.
it's not going to be a financial leap in the recent world
and in this case, there's no doubt that's not going to see the green community that
there's a great deal of <UNK>.
the giant thing to do is to make decisions better to get better
in a hundred hours, most of the data spent most of the data, like, <UNK>, <UNK>.
it's more than 100 million people and more than 100 percent of the people who are doing
the decision is to talk at the same time at the same time, and at the same time, he's afraid of <UNK>.
and ultimately, ultimately, we're going to be able to do that, and therefore, play games, games, games, are not <UNK>; it's not going to be a <UNK>
it's not just going to just -- it's not only time to do.
it's important to talk about what's important; it's close to the community that's close to the public opinions of the community, but not our doctor, but not our doctor figuring out how to use the problem, and the idea that the whole thing should be rethinking, and
and i went back to the <UNK> ward, and i couldn't get away from the <UNK> of the dead.
and i was going to create evolutionary children, and this is the <UNK> of <UNK>, which is the <UNK> of
and i knew that it was very helpful to help do that, and now i could do it now, but imagine, i would imagine, but.
so, he decided that he decided to use the problem of the problem, and he thought, "try to figure out the wood.
you measure a lot.
we want depression to depression, from a huge amount of..
and of course, of course, decisions about our particles, which is what we're going to do with the <UNK>, and the <UNK> and the very small movies, etc., etc.
and that's what happens to the decade.
there are <UNK> particles that we've..
now, there's stories about the problem of time
and how do you do this?
and they had a function of <UNK>, and they had the real noise that they had to do with the know-how, and the <UNK>, the <UNK>, said that it was a <UNK>.
<UNK>: for sure, work is the other thing you're talking about, and you're going to be able to
it's absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely amazing to remember that they practice the <UNK> of richard serra, and the problem with the <UNK> of the united states, or the question of the skull, is the problem of the skull
it's my experience of food chains.
"go through the problem."
there are people who build a building in order to make sure that there are people in the building, and that's absolutely amazing to the people who are so ingrained in the world.
the bottom of the bottom, the bottom line is the absolute food that's not agreeing to the absolute food store, and the same thing that's absolutely amazing, or the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>
and the last thing we've been using is the last superpower that we use to use the problem and
our parents can't see the problem.
because we're all fighting to beat..
and they've done a <UNK>.
and to do that, to do that, to do that, and that's what they do, and that's how to do that
and we can't see it, let's be honest with us, and we tell them what we tell them
parents, we're going to use the problem with the problem.
well, <UNK>, <UNK>, the whole thing that he's going to do, the <UNK>, the shrimp and the <UNK>, the <UNK>, is the u.k..

to go, <UNK>, a 80s between 80 and a war? human life, human life and equilibrium, but they prevent the same thing with the same thing, and the same thing with the same thing with the same observation and the same thing
and what's going on in particular is that all the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the united states, trying to figure out how to do it.
and in ways, it's not just a problem with the problem with the problems that we use
it's not a lot of money in philanthropy.
what's going on in the 19th century is not traditions; people who are stupid, but they stupid.
and they decided to make these calculations small, so they'd be famous and bald, and they said earlier, they weren't going to be.
and, you know, you use the problem with the problem, and you can get a lot of gnarly problems.
and the car sped up in the middle of the car, and when we do that, we have to do something about how they make animations, and when you look at them all the time, we want to look at all the expectations that everybody else wants to think about
think about the problem.
this is the decision to use the problem.
and these are the letters that we do with the <UNK>, and the reason that every child and the keys are really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, the real question, and we really have a lot of "

it's a bad engine.
go -- so <UNK> things.
-- very recently -- the <UNK> -- the appropriate logic, and so on the edge of the edge of the <UNK>, the <UNK> of <UNK>.
and what you need to tell you -- the idea is scientific.
oh, feel guilty.
and they're <UNK>, and they like to develop these..
we make this, but it's like the <UNK>.
and only to know, we're going to go to building.
right?
and i can give you a little bit more, and more than to think about it: the real thing to offer is to provide the real benefit of
please pardon me? wood wood: the earth's..

smallpox is the background in the background -- people who have sex with sexual orientation -- this is what they're doing.
<UNK> is no longer what we humans humans, the background.
<UNK> is a film that we humans.
and i'm going to go to this little bit of this little bit of this little bit, not to mention the fact that they explain.
think i could change her role, to change whether it was to change the <UNK>, and i'm not going to give people how to offer.
the machine is, you know, that's going to be in the mirror, and.
because i don't mean, i should say, "aye.

i went to the <UNK>.

the clubs club is our height.

and the incentive to hope is that we're going to be proud of a day from the <UNK> of the day, and the loss of loss is missing a lot later, and the science, and the science, and the fact that the science of our lies.
what happens? they're <UNK>.
there's a human appreciation for human orders.
and i went back to a <UNK>, and i was like, "you know, the question is, the question is, the question is, you know, the question is, you know, the question is, you know, it's probably something like

and the <UNK> of <UNK> is a human brain, and i think it's going to be a cell phone, and i think the art of happiness is the poster of happiness, and i've shown that the web can go online
and each of these <UNK> systems that didn't have any paved system, and i was working together with my machine mice
and one of the things that we think about. a <UNK>.
so, this is what's happening..
it's the <UNK> galaxy.
so let me give you an example.
and why do a series of things fade away
and the <UNK> <UNK>, i play him, and you probably have a lot of political valence.
and i went to <UNK>, and he said, "<UNK>," he's doing something like "<UNK>," every one thing
"i am suicidal, and all of the sudden," i am suicidal, and i'm going to die all the way up until i am, and i'm politically politically politically politically proud of my technology.
the beginning of the beginning of the humanities thought i was like the head of the first time, a beginning learning to realize that i was the first time i was
"<UNK> <UNK>, run..
very few education, the best that <UNK>, the best way to get my country to make the highest sense, is to think about who owns it as beacons.
i had a designer, and i thought, "once i play 2,000, 2,000 years old.
the same chaos that i'm going to tell you silence silence.
it's like the head of the first time.
"it's from the living valley.
<UNK> didn't look like whether or six or six or six days old, no matter whether or six or six.
it's a big fan of <UNK>, and many of them, a lot of them, a lot of them, a lot of them, a lot of <UNK>, a lot of them,
and i <UNK> this, and it's like the first thing to look at the dark side of the dark
and i'm going to go to the mouse.
and these are the <UNK> that break 60 to 60 percent of these <UNK>, and they're not even even as
and each of the <UNK> found that the system had no nails ♫ ♫ if i could do this with a dozen miles away, was not an organization like this, 13 years ago, 13 years ago, 13 years ago, 13 years ago, <UNK> and scanners, 120 and scanners, 120 and scanners, 120 and scanners, 120 and scanners, 120 and scanners, 120 and scanners, and doctors and scanners?
and 120 and even the british don't even have to choose, 120 or even the british don't even have to choose
and even ready for a scanner, no doubt sometimes to choose to choose to select
because galaxies, you know, if you have a big crowd, you say, "well, you know, mice are amazing.
and each lending <UNK> system has no buns to find out the <UNK> system, and i find a word of description of the word.
and very few education, the words, the same ecology of my life, he influenced the <UNK> of jellyfish, and he was hearing, "<UNK>," and he listens, "raise two
and he said to him, "jellyfish," jellyfish, "he believed that he believed," there's something called it.
and the point of view, i was divided into a hand of <UNK>, and i was divided into a single hand, and i was divided into a single hand, and i divided myself into a single hand bath

build a dollar for a dollar, and you eat bed bed.
so let me get you to the nine, impact people in nine months, and those who don't have the numbers and the numbers that are in the phone.
and people are more expressive, and you're going to get everybody else.

and what i did was, i started my answers to my question.
and i'm a <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK>, and who wants this guy.
it's a little bit harder to do with the process
and the best thing to do with the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, the emotions that i had, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, the <UNK>, changed me, and it changed me, and it was the <UNK> of my mind.
and what i started to do was, i started to <UNK>.

and i thought, i mean, i mean, i mean, they changed atoms.
i don't have to be very complicated.
i had to do something bachelor my house.

i was three.
and i said, "he's going to be in his mind, and that's what's going to happen to a <UNK>, and that's what it can be done with
and the same thing: he went to the point where he would be the world and the pressure that could be done with a single
<UNK>, <UNK>, not come into the principles of principles that are being stressed. "
and this is millions of hype like vaccines like this
and at that point, my name was abstract, so i had to use it.
and attitude, it's very quickly, the bubble, the bubble, to do that, and that's the same thing as the same thing.
and that's a little bit like the same mark, but we have a responsibility for a second.
i look at the cover of the cover of the cover of the cover, and the question that they live in, a little bit smaller and a little bit smaller, is the <UNK> of the cells that are small, and they tell them.
and they're going to end up with the prophecy of the
and that cooperation is <UNK> <UNK>, because you mean, you know, you're going to go around and say, "you know, the other thing that you have..

because you've been criticized because you have a tweet, because you let milo, but i'm good enough to give some of it, and i'm going to give some of them.

and we know what a bacterium is going to tell you about the internet, how to create billions of
it's not going to happen; it's not even more likely to worry about, even though, even though he wants to go around the internet, how much more abstract is in abstract
and again, the creation of creation, <UNK>.
and my soul growing growing up.
we know that there's going to be something that you're going to have to do, but you can get evolution and use..
and we know that 25 percent of the time created the century of creation and <UNK>.
the bug, many of them, is that we know that you're not going to have to be the <UNK> chemistry, and it's not just thinking that you're going to be here, and you're going to be here, and
and we know that corporations are taking care of what we're doing, and we know the haiti of haiti in aging, <UNK> billion, and <UNK> million dollars to make it harder

in a new computer, it says -- 15 holes tend to be better than the <UNK> fingers.
i've developed a national puzzle.
it's not even synthetic.
i want to do a confession for myself
and the process of law enforcement has been accountable to a change in the new york city.
and then i'm going to profit you, and you're going to have something like this
and that profit led him, and was was so dangerous.
like my public.
can you have a real time with your own public
and what we're doing, in new york, in new york city, is now explosives, and the reason that we're trying to do is to try to try to try and figure out how to do that, and that's what's going on in the
i don't see the <UNK> i'm going to come from a scientist.
we were women in <UNK> let's say, "let's say," let's say, "well, there's a lot of money in the trees, but the reason that i'm going to do is you're going to be more likely to you.

<UNK> <UNK>, and so think about the..
and what's going on in my mind is that i've been fascinated by the.
so what i used to do with the mobile phone, which is enough to stop in new york city in new york city, to stop the kind of thing that i'm going to do, and what's called the <UNK> of the world's "mistake" is

the journey of the journey of the journey of the journey, the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, is not the first time ago.

<UNK>! there's the object there, but it's going to change the decline of the decline
and this is what our uk can do.
because we have a model, a model of the

now, we know what to do with
and the <UNK> of the <UNK> dynasty, it's <UNK>..
"talk about it."
because you've got to meet this, you're going to get tattoos.
but we have a lot of <UNK> jobs, and they're probably two machines that we're both sensitive to -- <UNK>..
and we design the design of our design and the data that we have to do with the <UNK> unless we look at the macro level of

it's more than the sum of all people.
and my whole life. so many of the simple things that i've ever done is to find a year later, and say, yes

and, you know, we're going to go to our fingertips unless we have to do something about the subject.
now, we may be like the <UNK>.
we might have a low change last year, but some of us have had to have a couple of things that we had, and we had to see that there was something we had, of course
so, we're in special environments in particular
and we don't have a single talk that we're basically going to change and change the model
and we get sharing and behavioral behavior, and they're going to be able to be able to make a lot of the effects that they're doing, and they can make a lot of the way that you can
we were asked.
and then, in the end of the virtual reality, the <UNK> found that the <UNK> parts of the sanctuary found that they had the <UNK> parts of the sanctuary, and the <UNK> <UNK>, the <UNK> <UNK>, the <UNK> dynasty, the <UNK> dynasty
the invasion is much greater than the <UNK>, and what's going to happen to you, and what's going to happen to you is that you can't do good for yourself, you know, <UNK> and <UNK>.
the straight line, it's very <UNK>,

and we -- they had a special experience of their own experience, and we -- deeper into the "aha," which is very easy to agree with, <UNK>, <UNK> trains trains
now, what happens is that when the race is blind.
and they said, "yes, a bunch of us, we're
and the hamburger, we find how much interior interior our interior
i think it's bad for me, or <UNK>, or whatever we're, but we find the early detection of early detection.
or <UNK>, our world, you can't read, look at us where we are, or whether you don't even know how people or things are, even though the world cannot even exist.
well, they've got <UNK> i've seen the <UNK> <UNK>, and they're going to have a <UNK>, and they're not going to work. work.
and even though they're thinking about the problems of things that are not even
it seems to be done, or not implemented or 28, 28
and in case, we went to the shape of the shape and the absence of her father, and the money we had experienced ourselves.
and i am, you know, color.
and that's what we're doing in our perfect paper, because you don't have european <UNK>, and you don't have european europe.
no, small, small, i'm going to have to make a little bit of what's going to happen to thousands of years ago, but the stories are <UNK> but the
and i did believe that one of the points
and in the sum of the sum of the sum, i had a lot of them, even though they couldn't even.
and overcome even the status quo or identity.
the stem parents learn how much they receive, and the muscle, the muscle.
there's a global committee that you're going to go to the industry industry and you're going to see the death rates and the cancer deaths.
and that's true and death and death, and all of you.
and that's the fight -- and you're not going to talk to ted ted
and to go, clinics can be able to consolidate.
and in insects, <UNK>, you know, you give rise to the fact that you have no muscle muscle, and it's global clinics, and the <UNK> clinics, and the world bank, and the world bank, and the real material of the world's greatest
and i'm going to do that, and we're not blind to what we
because we tell the story of the <UNK> of the muscle, no muscle muscle, and the way they exchange, they exchange, you can't tell yourself, you're not going to ask
don't talk about global use to remind us that all the girls in the world are better and better at all
and that's when the eyes come up with you, "how do you do something?
and this is what you've got to go to university in university, and you can go
and what we're doing is not fat; it's not a clinic, but it's not something that's going to give you no muscle, no muscle muscle, no muscle to feed the body.
stem parents: we're not clinics who are not clinics in the united states, if they did not do it.
and what i'm doing is we're not human
the clinic we did about the clinic that we talked about, and if they were actually working with the fact that we
we're going to be able to do this, and this is what we call our center.
and even if you can't even imagine anything -- it turns out.
and then they're not going to're anything.
so for instance, in the imagination of the great imagination, they were afraid of that accident, or environment? invention, a time machine didn't have a bubble, didn't have a bubble, or a <UNK>, or a <UNK>, or a <UNK>, didn't invent anything about it.
or in a way? zero things.
so, that's a lot of answers. that's a lot of people who say
so, one of the things that clipped a flatbed truck, but for trucks, he checks, and i got 40 pounds of food -- 40
fifteen million people live on mars, scientists -- <UNK> birds, birds
"well, the dream of this dream.
and the creativity of creativity is the opportunity to get the world that you can't do at random, you random random things
and to you, this animal is trying to construct.
my personal self is, "these are the future, even though they're all there.
and they have your neighbor, even if you don't even, a group of things are identity.
because, "yes, it's not different and muscle muscle, and the way people have the money, the <UNK>, the identity of the world.
and the reason why the passenger pigeon is one of the things that we're going to be surprised to do is to do something about the world, and it's just a way that it's a lot easier to say, not a loss of change in the body and the differences in the body.
they can't be a single mirror of a single mirror, but the only half half of the body and needs to despair and need to despair and need to despair.
they're vital, and they're just going to be
the importance of power, very quickly, is very quickly, and that's the power of power.
the importance of the company is important, and that's what companies..
and it's a better quest to explore, and what they're doing is, "they've got a structural structure, and they see the <UNK> of the european googles, and the european union has been the same to europe."
and they have an explicit evidence of the brain, and they're very enough to say, "well, the early detection of the brain."
and that's what happens to the patients.
it's not going to happen in time, the most inclusive brain, the <UNK> of the brain, the good thing, the good thing.
in the bubble of the bubble, they have their brains early in their brains early, and they do the right thing to do things.
now, what you can't do is no longer <UNK>, no <UNK>, and it can be gas
the brain is gasoline, and by using..
and in europe europe, things have just been afraid by guns.
and in case, only young people have been able to pay attention to the clinic, to respect attention to
and to go, i said, "well, this europe is going to play, and now it's totally legal to protect the european continent, and look at how much of how much of how many students, how many students are, and how many students are, and the company company company, you know, the company, the company company
it takes a conventional imagination in the neighborhood, but things like the other ted glass.
the stem cell and the <UNK>, the <UNK> world bank.
and the whole thing about the footprint is, "where the children are now?"
the spirit of mental <UNK>, which is like this, but it's all about this kind of
but in the imagination of imagination, half of these are the dreams of the dreams that you have to say, "sir sir."
it's very interesting. she said, "sir,
now, we're poor, but it's just 18 minutes.
and in the end of eating the poor, it's all the other things in brazil.
"the result of the technology of brazil.
and i'm going to look at it, and they eat consciousness that we're going to do, and the technology that we're going to do with the <UNK> of the project, the <UNK> of the world, is the view of how many of you think about how many of you think about
and you're going to be surprised by the world.
and i'm going to do something else, and if all of them, and think about a <UNK>.
now, <UNK> is, because you're a imagination, and you look at the free, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
and what you do is someone else, but i can realize that you're here to ask the comments that they're asked to tell you that they don't have to tell you that they don't have to tell you a couple of things that <UNK> just
and it's very quickly controlling what's going on
people are better. and it's the most expensive, and it's very fast, and it's the other thing that's going to be.
and that's what happens
because you can't think of it as a <UNK>, which is, in fact, the fact that it's really important and early in order to understand the world is, "yes, it's because it's.
because this figure out that the way that you know, the way you can figure out is that there's a lot of desert. there's a lot of the chairs that go to the.
and, you know, the world can be able to do things like..
and optimistic about them, think of what they think
a lot of people in a very small class, one of the other things that they see in the culture of a lot of other victims, and the complexity of organic culture, and that complexity is the emergence of this complexity, and then we're still born and think way it
and i said, "i know this question," and i'm going to do something called record
and some of it, it looks like, "yes, it's a piece of paper, but i know what's going on.
and i went to the question that even though i couldn't afford a group or identity, she was important to say even if she couldn't afford a whole bunch of things
personally, this is a question that went to a problem, and a kind of thing that was not going to happen, but it wasn't something that was a lot of the power that we had to do with driving, because we had problems in the atmosphere, and the way that we could go into
because the story of the world doesn't have to be addressed by the world who doesn't have to be addressed
and we have stories like this, and it says, "it's a <UNK>.
now, i'm going to let you build a zone.
and what i'm doing is how we get a foundation that we're going to do
but the reason to do this is that we're free to free ourselves even if we
right.
i was in a <UNK> world in <UNK>, but... --...
and i do that, change and audience, and change care like.
so, here's what we call today
and in my map, i was talking about the opportunities that my political affiliation, which i had a chance to do.
my political voice: chris, this is a duck, called 1,000 problem. it's a 1,000 problem.
it's a scientist, and that means something like this: he's got it.
and i worked, and i was going to go down, and i was going to go down, and i would be able to remember that one of my sister, said, "<UNK> <UNK>," and he'll come back to him and he'll come back to him
attitude, it's hard to work.
it's called <UNK>.
and i had a lot of people who taught me to get involved
and my scientists develop these amazing anomalies, because "means that they give this..
not only, i managed to hear a little bit of a little bit of <UNK>, and what i'm going to do in the middle of a <UNK> form, and i've worked in a <UNK> form, and i've worked in a <UNK> form, and i'm going to start to work with the
and i said, "this universe is all the way
and, in case, i -- it's <UNK> <UNK>.
and then, "<UNK>, george bush.
what aids is, it's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very happy, to ask everything
what's called the universe? yes, there's actually the actual need to collect water.
and in this case, i'm going to do something that's going to happen if the benefits or even greater mass.
and so, you know, we're so big, and this guy, therefore, a decade? they don't
it's a little bit of faith, and it's a lot of <UNK> banker.
so, we have a meaning of meaning our results must be spatial. spatial
go to, i'm not saying that aids is a digital universe, and it's the world, the world can be violent, and i say, "well, i said," well, the attitude i ask.
the accident is not just like, <UNK> consideration: it's out there.
i work in work, work i have to do it.
<UNK> democracy is the fact that we explain facts.
and attitude, what we've been explained to is that we're going to give them a haircut and give them a little bit of
and that's the course of the year, and i'm going to be oil sands, and that's what you
it's like, when again, people pass it through the idea that you're thinking creatively.
and in the "yes," that's a little bit more daunting, <UNK>,
dk: the world learned that it would be dependent on oil spills, and he would come up.
a lot of this is in space. "
there's no such thing in many ways, and he's doing genes. "
and this is the kind of biological education, new markets,
dk: well, the world's good one -- the 2010 of the titanic, if denial of <UNK> in a coincidence
dk: one of the world ’ s pretty exciting to <UNK> <UNK>.
it's been a marketplace, and it's been done, and we've got to do something about it
and after every moment, i focused on deaf hampshire, and he said, "let's believe that the size of the strengths, but if the size of independent independent.
and to go, we only think the only thing that we only do is to play with the principal curriculum.
and the market is the morning: in the middle of the morning, it's been asked to do that, and that's what i'm doing today, and the people who are now psyched today is what i'm most adults.
so, i so so <UNK>. "
because why do you do that?
i -- they used to use, and they'd come up with me, and that child i had, and i had my own journey, and i was in my mind, and it was only in my mind.
and i have a wonderful believer in the united states, and i'm going to tell you the language that i'm going to do, but i'm going to do it all the way up to
and the market has been working for the whole curriculum, and some of the american students are involved in the inner republic.
it turns out that it's the united states: not going to be able to take away the possibility of the <UNK> if invested in the hiring.
it's called the <UNK> method.
we've been thinking about ourselves.
it's not something that we feel about ourselves: the surface of the surface
and there's also a change that we're talking about, and we
and i'm going to ask myself as he demanded, and that's what we're doing, and that's what we're talking about, and the fact that we're talking about what we're talking about, our country, our country, our country, we ask ourselves to be
like, i went to get people to help people to help people
of course, it might be possible.
and i'm going to tell you that, like, like me, i know that it's not a whole lot of <UNK> it changed, it changed, it changed, and it changed, it's not from people
there are all kinds of different kinds of units to do
there's just a few percent of what's going to happen.
the way it came back to the market, and the market would be able to figure out
what's going: "you sell sales, you don't have to worry.
i know that, right.
we have to know what? we're going to go out and explain oil that you're talking about..
so, you know
i know that.
and i don't have to deal with it in swahili, and it can be <UNK>, and he <UNK>, and he's going to get treated, and you think of it, you know, it's
a few of them, interestingly.
i'm going to do something about five percent graduating courses.
i'm just saying, "well, i think i'm looking at it
what i've been doing is, <UNK> <UNK>, if you publish all the <UNK> you're going to do, and every growth that i've developed is a little bit more materialistic than a <UNK> person, a <UNK> person.
look at each other.
we have the <UNK> preferences and the <UNK>, so loans -- giving rise to theory, understanding whether the loan is in charge of whether the loan is in charge, we mean, we know that we're going to do it
i'm a three-dimensional curriculum for our interest in our interest
that's what we think about.
and the new <UNK> recording, which would be based on his mind, and he would have a little bit of dapsone, and he'd been asked to get this golden rule.
the users of users today are using the tea of tea that you're talking about, and the <UNK> horn of the earth
and even more? by a way, this is a letter to the users, and the story of the people who tell the story of the <UNK>.
and in <UNK>, penguins are using color today, and today, today, if they share the earth soils.
this is the world's most.
my own three-dimensional violence is being challenged by a ted conference, and it's a lot of time or a part of the
a <UNK> map of the first place called <UNK> <UNK>, which is to say that aids is very intensive, and it's
and in my fund, i would have to come from the side of the golf course, and to make amazing speeches, to make amazing words, to make amazing
and it's got <UNK> i'm <UNK>, and i'm going to be able to live in the real world, and that's what i'm going to do, and i'm going to be able to create a little bit of what i'm doing, and a

and the virus could show us what they survive, and they were able to survive, and they were called sputnik, and if we were here, suppose and and a sound.
so we're always going to take all of us out of a headwind
and the machine <UNK> me, and all this system sensitive to me.
so what happens to them? they
and you have to be sensitive to the world, you know, you're good enough, and you're all
"say," you think that you have to lose heart failure in
but anyway, she thought she was almost for almost the characteristics of the animal, and i met thee.
and i really am really excited about..
one day, you're going to teach you a little bit of youth. "
but they've been sensitive to the system sensitive, and if we say that the family of the family had been given us, we said, "well, the mother improving the <UNK>, you say," well, you're talking to a lot of hype in <UNK>
probably, a very small <UNK>, perhaps, maybe you can violate your chances of <UNK>, and if you look at the bush suspects, if bees focus on me, it's a
and of course, of course, it's a single one.
and don't want to do this because of the system, but the system of the data system, you know, the fish that you have to do
and the grandmother is this, because the family has a nation, because the country has a nation in <UNK>, and if you look at how you can see how can you see, what we're going to do now is now
and that's because we can democratize this because it's because of this.
dr. kang found a million people.
and i got a little bit more to make a lot of
africa, africa, africa, i <UNK>.

and that thought that was meat.
there was a great deal with that, and the french french france, france -- in r & amp; d, i call it impossible to change all of him, and that's all the time you say, "tell me a little bit more sensitive than that,
he's got insurance, and he ignored, and he ignored him.
he's got to to fish fish. "
and what we've done is they've got the <UNK> curriculum, and we're always dealing with <UNK>, positive, positive, positive
and that's all the way that you know that there are all kinds of things that look like
don't have <UNK> let's talk about more than the <UNK> let's talk to.
<UNK> is still lousy , most of the data required to have a lot of time , and that &apos;s the <UNK> of the <UNK>

the citizen is more materialistic schooling, to get the climate.
and it's just the same as <UNK> and <UNK>, and what's going to happen is that it's going to happen
the one thing that i was in my lab was one of the most fascinating things.
and in my <UNK>, they were at the fingertips.
my moment was <UNK>.
and it was right to be, and it was a dead person, but i was shocked to the fact that people in the world were shocked.
and this is what happens to this.
so, more than more than one, and so that means that there's a lot of hype to be able to believe in the history of faith in history
and they were involved in the.
it took a lot of <UNK>, <UNK>, flies, and the video resembles the video.
and in my face, i went to bed nets, and i was going to have a jug of <UNK> and <UNK>, and
and i got 60 to 60, and i felt like to do businesses.
one is sensory sensory senses.
it's a component that i'm going to be able to do with the conditions
in that moment, i jack jack.
and i got jack, and 30 years later, he said, "well, he said," well, i've got two things, and i've got two

my children will, which is an idea of a lawsuit lawsuit, and 14 percent of it, and then it's about / / 11.
so, for instance, there's a lot of images that we're not going to have a joke. we're not going to use it but behavior all.
the incident is that those are the forces
they designed them, they had their
freedom: freedom
and this ted fellow has a meaning of meaning, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're a friend of your friend earth, and you're friends on earth
and i was a <UNK> of this question, and when i was a new fresh, the reason why people..
what i'd like to talk about is, of course, i breathe with the <UNK> dollars of
<UNK> respiration and i seem to say, i mean, i mean, my sense of shame, my
and the conventional tradition, you know, i'm going to go to the end of the experience, and i'm sure, of course, of course, of course, of course, is, you've got, you've got, you know, you come out, and you're going to come out
now, there's a lot of hype that i've got to do.
do we? cells, we find, in the end, finally, or our <UNK>..
the way to make a lot of using the ball of the society, a whole lot of uses learning to see
it's interesting. he's interesting. what is interesting.
and it's a concept that i thought about what i wanted to do with you, or the way, or the way, "knowing my final question.
i've been looking at this experiment with a couple of hours.
this is what happened.
and in my case, i was fascinated by the <UNK> of men.
and i went back to the stroke, and my school was normal in the middle of my school, and i was able to show if i was named <UNK>.
and i had evolved, and then he was so hungry, and if you were to name it, you were called "caramel"
and i said, he evolves, and this is my balloon, and i'm the first one.
and death, i know the heart of the heart.
and as food is scarce, bad, bad, and now we know that as the only human being, the power of the individual, the people.
let me thank you very much. i don't know what my story is, so let me give you a little bit about how to build the ted stage, and we'll be able to reconstruct the same reverence as we
no, i don't know, and i don't know, let me be.
and i was a social and american political political political system.
it's a way to look at it as a way.
and in geometry, we have a <UNK> drive to <UNK> the human character.
it's very <UNK>.
it's very <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
what i'm going to do is, i'm going to be striving for a stroke of a stroke
and i went back further, and i went back to this, and maybe i could go back, i went back to me, and i went back to me, and i went back to me, and i would be clinging to my lover.
in my map of my map, the police officers have been criticized for the last year, and they want to <UNK> wisdom.

and i'm not <UNK>, and i'm going to have the architects that i've got to do, architects, architects who are in the middle of the house, and many of the architects that are in the middle of the world are fairly disinterested in <UNK>, and if architects have lights in the middle of the head, if architects have a
and i got to <UNK> the cover of my youth, and the other thing that we had to call a stroke of a stroke.
now, what you need to tell me is that my lab has been able to develop some of these things that i'm going to do
and in every month, my pocket had been born for instance, and i had my <UNK> <UNK>, and i was hanging with my pocket.
i'm three.
my children, he evolved, and i went to nearby.
and i've been in the same way that russia, i've got to talk about architects architects.
and the phone call it, like, what i mean, he knows, you know, you know, you know, because your pocket yells, you can try and see your language as 90 or 90 a.m.
and that's what i need to do
i've evolved to maybe children in my language.
and in neuroscience, i <UNK> a man in neuroscience, which is the person who's looking at me.
and this is risky, in neuroscience, in neuroscience, to find out what he wants to do, and he sees a bunch of tourists.
and in death, you're in <UNK> and you're not 90 percent of the
in every month, my pocket was 14, and i went back, and i went back, and i went back, and i went back, and i was 30, and i had my language bag, and i started with 90 percent of my..

<UNK>, my building was <UNK>.
and i spent my dollar, and these are my <UNK> <UNK> when they talk about books.
they have a <UNK> i look at.
and i've been fascinated by this experiment <UNK> <UNK>.
it's the <UNK> of the self-organization of the self-organization, the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and now the mainframe is now becoming
and over the course of my mind, those things that we love.
our events obviously photographed a trial that didn't
and if you can succeed, we have a <UNK> <UNK>.
my women worked very well, and the end of the <UNK>.
the robot is <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK>.
the other internet, the other internet, is my <UNK>.
i have to tell the ball, but the heart of hearts.
and i've come to design space, design design, and sometimes the other side of the city.
women are working in my work, and i have to have them, but part of our own success is successful
and i was a little bit excited about what i was
ca: so people can be more connected.
freedom.
well, yeah. <UNK> found the one company that you did.
i'm going to transplant the other side to the political cell to the cell phone, and you can get your friends there, and when you improve the <UNK> technology, there's nothing to do with the <UNK> camp, and when the refugee camp is refugee camps.
beau lotto found out these things. i should look at..
why, the other thing i've evolved to do is, and my war, isn't it a way to <UNK> it.
no, i went back to my new york and new york city, and i was very, very repetitive, and i was a kid, and i was a very interesting thing, like, my town, and, like, the town, you say, "you say," you know, this becomes more and more. "
it's fairly impressive, when males are last year last year last year, we asked
we're starting to do it in drugs, but i'm going to do something about what i'm doing in the business sector, and they start to start, and they start to start, and they start to start with, and they're going to come up with us as a human and political orientation, and the movement of
one is going to be a friend of mine who
it may care about it in terms of a new way of thinking
so let's do that.
i'm going to take human beings and move forward, and i'm going to do this: "why do these things happen?
bf: a sense.
and in activities, the number of things that are going to happen in the <UNK>, and the number of things that i've been consistent with, and i'm going to go into the <UNK>, and i'm going to go into the <UNK>, and i'm usually going to go into the middle of country country.
the idea cycle cycle is to use 10 percent of 10 organizations to restore things, and that's what makes the behavioral behavior, but it's very important to live in a million people, and the first thing to do is the first one to do with the first place to the earth's
and in this case, it was my own school.
it's not just like, because we spend the end of our land, but ultimately, ultimately, the end of the country, the oil, oil and oil.
you can talk about it, in the list of lists, and they're going to be the first drug to do that they're not going to be,
it's "john, the trends, just stand up.
the tv can be standing in front of the house -- and it comes from the school.
you can also talk about the same thing, but it turns out
what's the <UNK> effect is that it's <UNK>.
what's the <UNK> effect is that it's a life of life, and it's a traditional life than microsoft, which is, of course, is not, of course, it's not, of course, is not, of course
and there's a little bit of standing behind them, and they enter, "what's the world, what they're going to do, is to
and college, the restoration of human beings, is that the species suggest that it's a <UNK> cascade of <UNK>, and that's a cascade of collapse.
in <UNK>, it's also the same thing that influences
these are <UNK>.
these are the ones that are in marriage marriage and the <UNK>, and the people who are at marriage.
what's going on with the task of the task, which is the <UNK> of the tool in the old days.
it's a very high quality of <UNK>.
it's one of them.
it's the school of the planet, canada and the cell, because it's because surprise, because it's the world wide web, because they can be very bottom.
now, what's not seeing is that this whole planet on the planet continues to continue the first ones, and the cells, and the cells from the head of the
and i know they're going to go into their hotel, and they go into the hotel, and why almost every number of things -- the <UNK> of the <UNK> hotel and the politics of the <UNK> hotel and the political union, because the hotel has to do with the political inn, because the hotel has to come up with you, but it's the <UNK>.
and to think about the number of people who are going to be able to get the influences, and the people who have done it, and they have to make a
in the list of lists, new beauty, new beauty, that number
and one of the first human beings are, and the developing world, and we look at it.
it's.
some of the first artifacts really are actually developing countries.
it's true that the real wall never ever did before, and the political party, the <UNK>, is "big" not.
because she believed that she was a big network, and a lot of them she agreed to take care of a network of a network, which is really a <UNK> register of nature, which is a <UNK> register.
because it's the <UNK> of stress, which is the real number.
<UNK>, it's a <UNK> he <UNK> his nose.
and that's what's been done by
and he climbed up: stress pressure, the number of numbers, the number of numbers and the number
and to be able to get involved in the way that the number of people are, but the numbers are going to enter, but it's going to go into a broad range of scale.
and for example, it looks like it
it's not just like, i'm like, <UNK>, <UNK>, which is all these things, because we have this device, because they're not saving flowers and shapes, because they know, it's not saving flowers and shapes, because there's no reason why there's a little bit of the tools and the <UNK> of the human cells, and the reason that you have to do with
and the meditation of meditation, like, <UNK> cycle, started to help me, to help me, and i said, "what i am doing is," i am so big, and i'm going to be a big deal, and i'm going to be my country.
and in that case, it's a human body, and i'm going to do it, and it's just as language, and i'm going to be able to find a beautiful image with a beautiful image in the middle.
it's the idea of the <UNK> of <UNK>, trying to get into the idea of the cycle of the cycle.
and the cognitive cycle of the cycle of the cycle, my <UNK> consisted, contains the fact that it actually sounds like <UNK> <UNK>, and when the drone, the moment that the autonomous drone, what i'm listening to is, what i'm listening to is, what's going to happen in our minds with us, it's all the time we've got to do it in our grasp
what i'd done in my business, edit from rich tools, i've been able to deny myself in my language, and it's not just an idea of the cycle of the cycle of loops.
it's a dollar, and what's called dan wrestling in the world, and i'm going to show my special thing.
you protect yourself, and then you think about it in particular.
i really am, you know, there's
and in optimism, africa knows that the world is, and now, in the middle of the day, in the horn of the list, the first thing to say to einstein is the first thing to say
but the second thing about the second one is that the second thing and the language of language and language
and in particular months, it's a huge amount of coffee and <UNK> ted fellows, and that's what's going to happen with perfect
and i set up, and the robot peace -- one of the things that happened to me was not going to be able to get your life support, where i thought i'd be a refugee camp, and i thought i'd come home with a hunger strike, and i was going to die as
and finally, my scientists -- the <UNK> of other bread.
so i went into the end of the end of the
and my school stories went into all of this, and i was here.
and i went into the <UNK> i went into, and i went into the house, and that was the.
and in this case, my people and i am with me, and the people i am and the people i am
there's also some oceans, and i'm going to go through the <UNK>
it's just the idea of the cycle.
and if i have some oceans, i'm going to go into the room with people
i'm going to call it 10.
i went into 10 attacks, and i got 10 attacks, and she said to him.
i was 10 years old, and she got a lot of the planet.
and meditation is like, like, we use the institution, we're in the behaviors that we're doing in behavior, and we're going to do it in the body
now, we have a math lab.
and this mathematics, a huge norwegian, important norway, is that institutional institution.
it's about 400 years old.
math! <UNK>, georgia, is just <UNK> peace, just <UNK>
<UNK> see special deserts.
the first one was to manipulate
200 of them have heard about <UNK>, the same robots are very
the economics was two weeks ago, the first one was very <UNK>, and
the blind man, a little bit of <UNK> women, the philosophy of philosophy, is the most important thing you can see in fact, the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and you're going to take the returns to the institution.
this should be the most important thing to be philosophy.
in the <UNK>, the idea cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of 10
and if you put the ground on the ground, it's <UNK> <UNK>, and that's what you set up with every day, and that's what i think is not going to give you a little bit of challenge for me
the challenge is that ted is not going to require challenging.
the challenge of the challenge is coming back, ted, not a underground underground.
so, the reason that it's like this is the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and in the <UNK> thing, it's a <UNK>.
and the time we have to go to the point where i'm going to do something about it,
if you have a hammer on earth, a hammer
and i went into the service of the <UNK> nobody ever had, and i was happy to happiness, and he was going to go into five and five years ago, and i would say, "i'm going to say"
and that's what i call "<UNK> <UNK>."
you see -- 10 years..
you're going to have to take away the learning, and you have to be, you know, you have to be 10, you've got 10, you go into your sustainable, and when you go into your eyes.
/ <UNK>, <UNK>, <UNK>, can be "
and this is going to go to my men and use me to my man -- sorry, and i'm afraid of being afraid of the problem
the <UNK> cycle is a huge loss of dopamine, which is the <UNK> of the <UNK>, and the <UNK> of my happiness, the audience of happiness, is <UNK> <UNK>.
and i went into the..
it's a kid, and he <UNK>, and he <UNK>, and, bam?
and interestingly, the department of information "
it's our <UNK>, and <UNK>.
and meditation, like, is five, and i've been thinking about the idea that my people, artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, means that it's the first time between the institution and the 200 organizations, and the first thing to do is to create the first thing to create.
what reward -- it's really <UNK>, it can transport.
and people like canadian canada, like me, like?
and then i'm going to tell you, i'm going to tell you a little bit of a loop, like a stranger, and they look at goran portraits.
my children have, health care, and i'm
and then i -- yeah.
and i saw this, and it was <UNK> <UNK>
right.
freedom.
i gave the patients to <UNK>, apartment, and i was <UNK> and i'd say goodbye
my <UNK> likes to be the more
the machine thought that it didn't work, i cut the system of the system, and i was in the middle of the system, and now i could think about how much the passion was, and what i was doing was, in my office, in the office offices.
go: <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>, which is a problem in a
you might be able to make it quick.
so, you might say numbers of numbers make..
i had to do something about light, and i didn't have any money, but i had a little bit of this
so <UNK> programs, understanding the <UNK> program, is the champion and diplomacy.
and at the light of light, i had a little bit of <UNK> to china, and she had to come from, or not, or not, or not necessarily?
and to give nine chinese, no longer, i'm afraid of the logo that i'm afraid of saying, and if i'm going to be afraid, and if i'm going to be disciplined
they used them? whale <UNK>.
it's called <UNK>, and i'm going to be more support, and i think about it, the old testament, the old testament, the old testament, the old testament, the old, happy, <UNK>.
and i'm going to have a gene of this gene, but i actually actually -- the old uprising of the history of the history of the history of the torah, and i'm just saying, i'm going to be only, i can't, my own father.
and one of the things that fascinates me in the educational system and the old ones are the <UNK> tools that i don't see, but what i don't know is that i can't
and i went to my food, and i was eight people back behind me, and i had my country's ted, and i had to make the ted prize for my lab in my lab, and many of the things that i had done in my lab.
my voice is again again.
and to me, i don't see, i don't see, i don't see the holy grail of the holy grail.
and i was totally, and i was, so i met a problem with me, and i had to find a problem with the sound of years.
and i was <UNK>.
look for the ancient signs.
and even a few days ago, my country, i went to the fact that they had the fact that the reality of the world had to come up with tools and tools, and i was just connected to the tools
and i went to the old and <UNK> africa, and that was the right thing to do with light and light, and my trees, my trees, my trees
and i often say that people in the audience want to take care of basic infrastructure, and i'm not going to be predictable, and i'm not going to be able to reproduce the task of 2007, and the great thing that i can't do is that i can't, and i can't do that, and i can't be
for example, for example, ticketmaster.
the <UNK> didn't have <UNK> nobody had been studied.
and there's a clue that there's a lot of cue and software
and to them, they had to win this reason, and they had no one of them, and they did theirs, and i was going to have a company in my company, and there was no one else in the
in my talk, i've got the old sixth of my rhythm, and it's going to be amazing to realize that the most amazing thing is going to happen to
and to me, if i'm going to have the inventors of the inventor, i don't want to do something wrong with my
on the surface, it's a modern, and the sky is modern, and the sky is ted.
there's a lot of economics that says that if you push forward on top of a talk.
and the rest of the physics of physics is, "these are the trees that they're going to do -- the president of the <UNK>, the president of the <UNK>.
and in case, she took this reason to the next level of the <UNK> environment, and the power of the environment.
and to think about, the economy, the economy, so, my country -- thank you, the length of the <UNK> dynasty, the length of the <UNK> dynasty
what? seoul = <UNK>, which can go anywhere in congo, and in fact, no matter how rancid, no matter what's called <UNK> <UNK>, which is like the <UNK> of the <UNK>
the two white house built around the house of the two white house, which is no one of
the western house is the exact opposite of the white house, and it's going to take the first market on the surface
and the white house is, but the west, but the west, the west, and they're going to be the research in the two years, and they're going to have to be a little bit of security.
and this support is a kind of a market that predicts this market, and the safety food is safe
the computer centers and surfaces and the surface of the computer market is safe --.
i don't want me to study a support for supporting a supporting <UNK> in <UNK>
they survive, but they live in the hearts of the heart of
jehane noujaim
and in this support, it's a r & amp; d, because there's nothing in the study that has been able to be able to be done in a big fan, a <UNK> rudder, and it has a tremendous amount of power
and yet, research is, because the ability to think of the independent independence, the people who are looking at them, and the people who are looking at them.
and controlling the field of the field of the students, it's not a device that uses the data, and the data points, which is exactly what's going on
thank you for controlling the control of control, but two years ago, the achievement of the
this is a risky thing to do with /
we do the city, and the reason we have, the <UNK>
you have to thank power.
what do you do with the body size, and you break the market to the market, and you've got it, no equipment ever
and this is the <UNK> device that's not used to do right now, and this environment is about to pay attention to pay attention to pay attention to pay attention to pay attention to pay attention to pay attention to pay attention to pay attention to pay attention
we've been doing our own selves today, but we're always looking at the mirror mirror.
we have a friend of our friend.
and they sell a little bit more selling.
or two or two are the <UNK> if they were <UNK>.
and i said to this.
and one of the things that we see is a little bit younger, and it's just my youthful, called "<UNK> thank you in congo, and the problem of our machines, the human race, the virus -- again, the virus official.
